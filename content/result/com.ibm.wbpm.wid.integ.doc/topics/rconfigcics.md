# Configuration for CICS programs

The following MQCIH header fields will need to be configured
if you want to invoke a CICS program.

| Field                                  | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CICS Program Name                      | The name of the CICS program that you want to invoke.  This field is required when targeting CICS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Transaction identifier                 | The transaction code to be used when invoking the program.  A transaction code is a grouping mechanism for applying application characteristics, such as security.  The default transaction code is the CICS(R) bridge transaction code (CKBP).                                                                                                                     |
| Coded Character Set Identifier (CCSID) | A Coded Character Set Identifier (CCSID) contains the information for working with characters as they are being processed, including the code page or code pages to be used.  It includes schemes on how to handle single byte and double byte characters with bidirectional languages.  The CCSID value for UTF-8 is 1208.  See Globalize your On Demand Business. |
| Integer encoding                       | The significance of the byte order sequence for integer values.  Reversed (little endian) has the numeric significance increasing, while Normal (big endian) has the most significant byte first.  Windows systems are Reversed, while pSeries and zSeries are Normal.                                                                                              |
| Decimal encoding                       | The significance of the byte order sequence for packed decimal values.  Reversed (little endian) has the numeric significance increasing, while Normal (big endian) has the most significant byte first.  Windows systems are Reversed, while pSeries and zSeries are Normal.                                                                                       |
| Float encoding                         | The format and significance of the byte order sequence for floating point values.  The formats are IEEE and S390.   With IEEE you can specify Reversed (little endian) or Normal (big endian).  S390 format is always Normal (big endian).   Windows systems are IEEE Reversed and pSeries are IEEE Normal.                                                         |
| Output COMMAREA length                 | The output data length need only be specified if the input and output data lengths are different.  The output data length is the length of data in the reply message to the client.  The length must match the size of the business object plus 8 bytes for the program name.                                                                                       |
