# Creating private business objects

## About this task

## Procedure

1. From an existing business object in the business object
editor, right-click a field and select Create private business
object.
2. A private business object is created in the business object
editor (note that the red icon  indicates
that it is a private business object and does not indicate
an error).
3. You can now add, edit, or remove fields as required (private
business objects behave like ordinary business objects in the business
object editor).
