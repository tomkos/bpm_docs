# Build it Yourself

## Learning objectives

- Create the directories
- Create a module to contain the service you will develop
- Import a business object to save you development time
- Create an inbound service using the adapter pattern wizard
- Create an outbound service with the same wizard
- Create a mediation flow
- Deploy the module
- Test the module

- Create the directories and input file

Several directories are used for the retrieval and storage of files. An input file is used for testing.
- Create a module

A module is similar to a project folder. It will contain the service you develop.
- Create customer business object

A business object is used to store your customer data, such as name, address, city and state.
- Create an inbound service

The inbound service receives the file from the file system for processing.
- Create an outbound service

The outbound service outputs a file that has been processed to the file system.
- Create the mediation flow

The import and export must be linked together through a mediation flow to allow data to be passed between them because the interfaces are different.
