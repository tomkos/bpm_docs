# Designing the case management client application

To create case pages, you can use client-side human services that use newer technologies and a
dynamic way of building pages in Workflow Designer. Or, you can continue using widgets to build
classic pages in Case Builder.

- Client-side human services for case applications

Modernize your case client application by using client-side human services that are based on newer technologies to create your pages. Pages that are created by using the classic widget-based method continue to work.
- Solution layouts

Solution layouts are new human service-based pages that provide case workers with access to the cases and work items in a case solution. Solution layouts are available to use with all the new case solutions or solutions promoted to Workflow Center.
- Creating new case layouts using human services

With human service-based page layouts, you can use the functions and flexibility of client-side human services to design your case pages according to your business requirements.
- Creating classic case pages using case widgets

With widget-based page layouts, you can use the features and functions of case widgets to design case pages that meet your business needs.
