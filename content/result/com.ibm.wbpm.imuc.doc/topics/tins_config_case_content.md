# Configuring case management or content management

- Enabling the case management features

If you intend to use the case management features after you upgrade to IBM Business Automation Workflow, you must enable certain features before you configure your case management system.
- Configuring IBM Business Automation Workflow case management for Db2 for z/OS

To use case management on IBM Business Automation Workflow with a Db2® for z/OS® database, after deployment you must configure the case management components including EmbeddedECM, IBM Content Navigator, Design Object Store, and Target Object Store. You also have the option of using an external ECM system instead of the embedded ECM.
- Extending your case management system

You can further enhance your case management solution by integrating forms, additional rules, analytics, and logging and reporting.
- Configuring Business Automation Workflow with a new external Content Platform Engine

You might be currently working with the BPM content store to store Enterprise Content Manager (ECM) information in IBM Business Automation Workflow. But you might want to work instead with a new external ECM system. You can configure Business Automation Workflow to work with a new Content Platform Engine. This configuration continues to use the existing domain and object store without migrating the data from the BPM content store.
- Configuring IBM Business Automation Workflow with an existing external Content Platform Engine

You can configure IBM Business Automation Workflow to work with an existing external Content Platform Engine, also called an external Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system.
- Optional: Configuring the Content Services toolkit

 The Content Services toolkit provides rich content views that you can use in your application to view and interact with documents and folders in IBM FileNet® Content Manager. You can configure the single sign-on between Business Automation Workflow, GraphQL WebSphere Application Server, and the Content Platform Engine server.
- Configuring IBM Business Automation Workflow with an external IBM Content Navigator

You can configure IBM Business Automation Workflow to work with an external IBM Content Navigator.
