# Displaying detailed error messages generated by custom applications

## About this task

Setting the display-debug-error-messages property displays detailed error
messages regardless of whether the application was started by using IBMÂ® Process
Portal or Process Inspector in Process Designer. Configure this setting only in development
environments to debug custom application code. Do not configure this setting in production
environments because the detailed error messages can be used to target security vulnerabilities.

A Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) value in parentheses is displayed after each error message
regardless of whether it is a detailed or generic message. For more information about the error,
such as the stack trace, you can correlate the UUID value with the
SystemOut.log file on the server.

## Procedure

To enable the setting to display a detailed message, complete the following
steps:

1. In the appropriate 100Custom.xml file in your topology (see the topic
Location of 100Custom configuration files for its location), set the property by using the
following format:

<server merge="mergeChildren">
      <debug merge="mergeChildren">
           <display-debug-error-messages merge="replace">true</display-debug-error-messages>
      </debug>
</server>
2. Restart the server.
