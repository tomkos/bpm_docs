<h1>Defining and registering target environments</h1>

<h2>Before you begin</h2>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>The first time that you run the Case configuration tool to configure the
production environment after you install IBM® Business Automation
Workflow, you must define at least one
target environment. Later, you can use the Case administration client to define more target
environments as needed to support your solutions.</p>

<p>A target environment definition specifies the target environment to which a solution
is deployed. It contains information about the connection point and a logical to physical page
mapping. By using the connection point, the target object store is discovered and the region number
isolated.</p>

<p>When you define a target environment, you select the connection point for the target object
store. Multiple connection points for the same target object store can exist. If required to support
solutions that you upgrade to Case Manager 5.2, multiple target environments can share the same
connection point.</p>

<p>When you register a target environment, you select the Case Client desktop that you want to use
to access solutions that are hosted in the target environment. You also specify credentials for the
user ID that you want to use to run workflows for case operations.</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To define and register a new target environment by using the Case configuration tool:</p>

<p>1 Enter the appropriate command for your environment: Option Description AIX®Linux®Linux for System z® Windows Perform one of the following actions:</p>
