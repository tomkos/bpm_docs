# Adding managed files

## Procedure

To add external files to your process application or toolkit:

1. Open a process application in the designer.
2 Click the plus sign next to Files and selectWeb File , Server File , or DesignFile . Note: To select a design file, you must use the Process Designer desktop editor (deprecated) .
    - Select Web File if you want to add images, .css
files, or other assets to use in your coaches.
    - Select Server File if you want to add JAR or JS files or some other
type of asset to use in a workflow implementation.
    - Select Design File if you want to add
.xsl files (content type text/xml or
application/xslt+xml) to override the transform XSL for one or more heritage
coaches.
3. In the New File window, click Browse to search for
the file that you want.
4. Select the file, and then click Finish.

Tip: In the desktop Process Designer, you can also drag
files or folders from your file system directly to the Files category. When you add folders, all the
files within the folder are added as individual assets. All files retain their original names. You
can also drag an image file from your file system and place it directly on a coach that you are
creating to add the file as a managed file.
