# Associating shared libraries with projects

After you create a shared library, you can associate it with your SCA
applications.

## Procedure

To associate the shared library

1. For either SCA projects or Java projects, add a dependency on the shared library. For more
information, see Adding dependencies.
2. For Java projects, clear the Deploy with module option to indicate the
use of shared library Java JARs.
