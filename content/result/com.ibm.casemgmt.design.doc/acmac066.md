# Exporting an audit configuration by using the command line

## About this task

The exportSolutionAuditManifest command exports audit configuration settings
that are associated with a solution to prepare for importing the audit configuration into another
IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow environment. Audit configuration settings are stored in
an audit manifest file. You must specify a development environment or production environment profile
with this command to provide information about the Content Platform Engine
server that contains the audit configuration. You can specify the path for the audit configuration
package or omit the value to use the default name and path.

## Procedure

To export the audit configuration:

1. Change the current directory to the
install\_root/CaseManagement/configure directory, where
install\_root is the location where Business Automation Workflow is
installed.
2 Run the following command. Do not enter any line breaks when you enter the command. configmgr\_cl exportSolutionAuditManifest -profile myprofile -manifestNames manifest\_names -manifestPackage manifest\_package\_file -solutionName solution\_name [-silent] [-force] [-help] -profile myprofile Specifies the profile to use. The myprofile value can be one of the following items: -manifestNames manifest\_names Specifies the name of the audit manifest. To specify more than one manifest at a time, entermultiple -manifestNames options with the command. -manifestPackage manifest\_package\_file Specifies the exported audit package ZIP file. You can specify the full path and file name forthe exported audit package ZIP file. If the path includes spaces, put the entire path in doublequotation marks. For example, enter "C:\Audit Packages\Security1.zip" . If you specify only the file name, the audit package is exported to theICM\_Home /CaseManagement/configure directory. If you do notspecify an option for -manifestPackage , the audit package is exported toICM\_Home /CaseManagement/solution\_packages/SolutionName \_auditManifest.zip . -solutionName solution\_name Specifies the name of the solution that is associated with the audit configuration. -silent Optional: When you specify the -silent parameter, no prompts orinformational messages are shown in the console, but the errors are written to the log. Failuremessages and validation error messages are shown as needed, such as messages about missing passwordsor invalid port numbers. If you run the execute command to run all the activitiesin a profile and you specify the -silent parameter, you must also specify the-force parameter. -force Optional and applies only when the -silent parameter is used. When youspecify the -force parameter, the activity is run without pausing for requiredresponses to validation error messages, such as messages about missing passwords or invalid portnumbers. -help Optional: Shows a brief message on the command syntax instead of running the command.

install\_root/CaseManagement/configure/profiles directory.
install\_root is the location where IBM Business Automation
Workflow is installed.
    - The full path to the profile directory, such as
"install\_root\CaseManagement\configure\profiles\develop1" or
/install\_root/CaseManagement/configure/profiles/develop1.
    - The full path to the profile input file, such as
"install\_root\CaseManagement\configure\profiles\develop1\develop1.cfgp"
or
