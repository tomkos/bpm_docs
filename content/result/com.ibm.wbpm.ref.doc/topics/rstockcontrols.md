# Coach views in the Coaches toolkit (deprecated)

- A description of the coach view and any additional information such as restrictions and
examples.
- A table that provides information about its binding such as the
purpose for the binding and the expected data type.
- A table that lists its configuration options, which you can see on the
Configuration page of a control instance. That is, you see these options when

one. The variables are defined in the Variables page of the coach view.
