# Completing configuration for migrating to a different computer

After you migrate to a different computer,
you might need to change some configuration settings that were not
updated automatically.

## Procedure

1. Ensure that all clients and tools can
access the new system.
If the old host
name is not redirected to the new computer, update the URL that is
used by clients and tools to point to the new computer.
Consider for example, browser clients, Workflow Center, and Process Designer.
2. Download and install the desktop Process Designer.

Note: The desktop Process Designer is
deprecated. Use the Process Designer.
3. Review your Java™ virtual machine settings
to verify that you are using the recommended heap sizes. See Java virtual machine settings. The
information at this link applies to IBM Business Automation Workflow servers as well as to
WebSphere® Application
Server
servers.
