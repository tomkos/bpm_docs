A note can remind you of further development that needs to be done.

## Procedure

To add a note, complete the following steps:

1. To create a note, click the note icon  at the top of the palette and click again on the canvas to
place the note.
2. Click the note association icon,  and then click the note and then an artifact. The note is now associated with that artifact. That association is
