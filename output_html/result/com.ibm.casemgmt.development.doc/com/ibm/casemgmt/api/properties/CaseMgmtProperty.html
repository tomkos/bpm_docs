<li><p>public final class CaseMgmtProperty extends java.lang.Object Represents a property belonging to an object in the case management system such as a Case object. Property objects allow you to access and modify the values of properties. Property objects also provide additional attributes about properties such as minimum and maximum values and choice lists. These attributes are typically associated with property descriptions in a Content Engine repository, representing the metadata of properties, and are associated with classes of objects rather than object instances. In a case management system, these attributes can potentially be determined dynamically based on the working values of the properties in a collection. This dynamic behavior can be configured by integrating with an external data service. The data type of a property is indicated by the getPropertyType method and returns a Content Engine Java API TypeID value. The following data types are supported for single-value type properties. Multivalue property values are represented by a java.util.List object for the simple types -- BOOLEAN , LONG , STRING , DOUBLE , DATE or GUID . The List object contains a list of objects of the types described above. When setting these multivalue property values, lists of other object types are accepted if they can be converted to the appropriate type of object as described above. Multivalue properties of type OBJECT are supported for properties that hold custom dependent objects. These types of OBJECT properties have a cardinality of LIST . Dependent objects are Content Engine objects that exist only in the context of a parent object, such as a Case object. Custom dependent objects are instances of CmAbstractDependent classes that are defined by a custom application, such as part of a solution in IBM Case Manager. Business objects that are defined in a Case Manager solution are created as dependent object classes and properties when deployed. The Content Engine includes other system-defined properties with system-defined dependent objects. These are not exposed through this API. Multivalue properties that hold custom dependent objects are represented by a Content Engine Java API DependentObjectList object. When properties are retrieved, this type of object is returned as the value of dependent object properties. When modifying this type of property, construct a DependentObjectList object and set as the property value. You can also modify the existing DependentObjectList object in the property value and the changes are saved when saving the parent object.</p></li>

<p>Property objects also provide additional attributes about properties such
 as minimum and maximum values and choice lists. These attributes are typically
 associated with property descriptions in a Content Engine repository, representing
 the metadata of properties, and are associated with classes of objects rather than
 object instances.  In a case management system, these attributes can potentially 
 be determined dynamically based on the working values of the properties in a collection.  This dynamic
 behavior can be configured by integrating with an external data service.</p>

<p>The data type of a property is indicated by the getPropertyType
 method and returns a Content Engine Java API TypeID value. The following data types
 are supported for single-value type properties.  </p>

<p>BOOLEAN: Represented by a Java Boolean object or null
         if the property is not set. When setting the property value, a String
         object is also accepted if it represents the string representation of a boolean.
LONG: Represented by a Java Integer object or null
         if the property is not set. When setting the property value, any Number
         object is accepted if it can be converted to an integer. Also a String object 
         is accepted if it represents the string representation of an integer.
STRING: Represented by a Java String object or null
         if the property is not set.
DOUBLE: Represented by a Java Double object or null
         if the property is not set. When setting the property value, any Number
         object is accepted if it can be converted to a Double. A String
         object is accepted if it represents the string representation of a double value.
DATE: Represented by a Java Date object or null
         if the property is not set. When setting the property value, a String
         object is also accepted with a date in W3C format using the UTC time zone.<br />
         Such a format corresponds to the following pattern that can be applied to a 
         Java SimpleDateFormat object: "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'".
         The time zone is "UTC".
GUID: Represented by a Content Engine Java API Id object or 
         null if the property is not set. When setting the property value, 
         a Java String object is also accepted if it is a string value of a 
         GUID with or without the curly braces.
OBJECT: Represented by a Content Engine Java API ObjectReference
         object or null if the property is not set. Currently only object references 
         are supported through the Case Manager Java API for properties. The API does not 
         currently support dereferencing object-valued properties to retrieve the actual 
         objects referenced. Also, the API currently only supports retrieving these single-value object 
         property values but not persisting changes to them</p>

<p>Multivalue property values are represented by a java.util.List object for the simple
 types -- BOOLEAN, LONG, STRING, DOUBLE, DATE or GUID.
 The List object contains a list of objects of the types described above. When setting these multivalue
 property values, lists of other object types are accepted if they can be converted
 to the appropriate type of object as described above.</p>

<p>Multivalue properties of type OBJECT are supported for properties that hold custom dependent objects.
 These types of OBJECT properties have a cardinality of LIST. 
 Dependent objects are Content Engine objects that exist only in the context of a parent object,
 such as a Case object.</p>

<p>Custom dependent objects are instances of CmAbstractDependent classes that are defined by a custom application,
 such as part of a solution in IBM Case Manager.  Business objects that are defined in a Case Manager solution are created
 as dependent object classes and properties when deployed.  The Content Engine includes other system-defined properties with 
 system-defined dependent objects.  These are not exposed through this API.</p>

<p>Multivalue properties that hold custom dependent objects are represented by a Content Engine Java API 
 DependentObjectList object.  When properties are retrieved, this type of object is returned
 as the value of dependent object properties.  When modifying this type of property, construct a DependentObjectList object 
 and set as the property value.  You can also modify the existing DependentObjectList object in the
 property value and the changes are saved when saving the parent object.</p>
