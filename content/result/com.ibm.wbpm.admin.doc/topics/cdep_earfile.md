# EAR file overview

An enterprise archive (EAR) file is a compressed file that contains
the libraries, enterprise beans, and JAR files that the application
requires for deployment.

You create a JAR file when you export your application modules
from IBM® Integration
Designer. Use this JAR file and any other artifact libraries
or objects as input to the installation process. The serviceDeploy command
creates an EAR file from the input files that contain the component
descriptions and Java™ code that make up the application.
