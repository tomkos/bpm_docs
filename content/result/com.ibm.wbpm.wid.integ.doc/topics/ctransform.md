# Message Transformation

In the mediation flow there are a number of primitives available
to perform transformations. These are: the Business Object Map primitive, Mapping primitive
and Custom Mediation primitive.

To transform the message in the mediation flow editor using an
XML map, define the scope of the message to be transformed with an
XPath 1.0 expression. Then, map the source and target service message
objects, using the XML map editor. This is done through a Mapping 
primitive. Custom Mediation can be used to transform
a message through the use of Javaâ„¢ code
or snippets.
