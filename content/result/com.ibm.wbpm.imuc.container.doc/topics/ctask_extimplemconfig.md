# Configuring how external user interfaces open in Workplace

You can use the embedInWorkplace=true|false custom property to specify
whether the external UI opens in a new window or tab or is embedded in the Workplace page. By default, the
external UI opens in a new window. If you opt for an embedded page, ensure that the external UI can
be embedded in an iFrame.
