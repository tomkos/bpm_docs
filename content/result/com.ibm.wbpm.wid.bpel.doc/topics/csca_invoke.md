# Invocation styles

A component exposes business-level interfaces to its application business logic so that the
service can be used or invoked. The interface of a component defines the operations that can be
called and the data that is passed, such as input arguments, returned values, and exceptions. An
import and export also has interfaces so that the published service can be invoked.

All components have interfaces of the WSDL type. Only Javaâ„¢
components support Java-type interfaces. If a component, import or export, has more than one
interface, all interfaces must be the same type.

A component can be called synchronously or asynchronously; independent of whether the
implementation is synchronous or asynchronous. The component interfaces are defined in the
synchronous form and asynchronous support is also generated for them. You can specify a preferred
interaction style as synchronous or asynchronous. The asynchronous type advertises to users of the
interface that it contains at least one operation that can take a significant amount of time to
complete. As a consequence, the calling service must avoid keeping a transaction open while waiting
for the operation to complete and send its response. The interaction style applies to all the
operations in the interface.

When authoring applications in IBM Integration Designer, it is a best to explicitly set the
invocation style that each of your components use to call each other. At a minimum, you want to know
what invocation styles are used throughout your application while you do performance analysis or
develop your error handling strategy. You certainly need to understand the interactions in your
application when you consider/set your transaction boundaries. Users are often surprised to find
that setting or determining invocation styles between components is not as easy a task as it seems.
This section explains how to set or determine which invocation style is used at run time, based on
specific characteristics of your application.

- Synchronous
- Asynchronous using one-way operation
- Asynchronous with callback
- Asynchronous with deferred response

- invoke(): Synchronous
- invokeAsync(): Asynchronous
- invokeAsyncWithCallback(): Asynchronous

In general, when considering an interaction from one component (source or client) to another
(target), the service client determines what type of invocation is used. For example, if your source
component is a Java component, the invocation style from source to target is determined by the
particular SCA invocation API you use in the implementation, such as invoke(), invokeAsync(), or
invokeAsyncWithCallback(). Each of the other components provided in Integration Designer has a set
of rules that it uses to determine whether an invocation is synchronous or asynchronous.
