# Simple disaster recovery

- Disaster recovery procedures

From the perspective of IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow, disaster recovery means that the production environment can be restored to the secondary data center through a well-defined replication method.
- Installation and configuration considerations

Consider disaster recovery as you install and configure your operating system, databases, and production environment.
- Recovery scenarios

Disaster recovery occurs at various times in a production environment. For example, in addition to the backups that occur according to a regular schedule, you also perform disaster recovery tasks as needed. The production environment might go through various states (for example, processes might be running) while the backup is taking place.
