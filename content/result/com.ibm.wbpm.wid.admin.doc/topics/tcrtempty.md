# Creating test suites without test cases

## Before you begin

## About this task

## Procedure

1. In the Business Integration view, right-click the component
test project where you want to create your test suite and then select New > Component Test Suite. The Create Component Test
Suite wizard opens. Note: If the component
test project is associated with a process application or toolkit,
the new test suite that you create for the component test project
can only test modules that are contained in the same process application
or toolkit. You cannot add a module from another process application
or toolkit to the test suite.
2. In the Name field, type the name
that you want to assign to the new test suite.
3. Click Finish. In the Business Integration
view, the new test suite is added to the component test project and
the test suite automatically opens in the test suite editor.
