# Team development in Integration Designer

## Reusing artifacts

Integration Designer enables
developers to reuse existing items, both within and across projects.
For example, if you know several artifacts already exist that you
and other developers need, you can access and reuse those items by
including them in a library. You or others can then reuse those artifacts
in other modules. To use artifacts from a library, set up a dependency
from that module to the library using the Integration Designer dependency
editor. You can set up dependencies on a library from any number of
modules. To learn more about modules and libraries, see "Libraries"
in the related links.

## Working with the Workflow Center

The Workflow Center includes a repository for all processes, services, and
other assets created in Business Automation Workflow authoring
environments. You can use the Workflow Center repository
to share artifacts with other users who are developing process applications
and toolkits.

Workflow Center
provides a convenient location in which to create and maintain high-level
library items such as process applications and toolkits. Administrators
who do not actively work in the designer view can use Workflow Center
to provide a framework in which BPM analysts and developers can build
their processes and underlying implementations. Another primary task
for administrators is managing access to the Workflow Center repository
by setting up the appropriate authorization for users and groups.

## Software configuration management systems

You can use Integration Designer with software configuration management (SCM) systems.
You can view or change the preferences for available version control
systems under Window > Preferences > Team.
For more information about working with SCM systems, see "Using remote
software configuration management systems" in the related links.
