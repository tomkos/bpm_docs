<h1>Workgroups are not marked as required fields in the Properties</h1>

<p>widget</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<h2>Resolving the problem</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a custom properties layout view that sets the workgroup
field to required. Use this view instead of the system-generated view
on any page that is used for the task.</li>
<li>Create a JavaScript to
set the required state programmatically by using the following syntax:controller.getPropertyController("Workgroup1").set("required", true);This
method marks the workgroup as required in the system-generated view
and in any custom views.</li>
</ul>
