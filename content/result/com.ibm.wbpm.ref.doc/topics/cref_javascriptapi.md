# JavaScript APIs

- JavaScript API namespaces

Some APIs are available only in the BPD namespace or only the Service namespace, but not both.
- Formats of case property values

When working with case operation JavaScript APIs in processes and service flows, several APIs use strings as parameters or return values to represent case property values. These APIs require case property values to be correctly represented as strings when used as parameters to these methods. There are multiple formats used to express properties as a string, depending on the property type.
