This section provides JavaScript examples.
- Viewing all process instances by using a TWSearch API query

When you use the TWSearch API to query process instances, only instances that you have tasks for are returned by default. To also return process instances that you do not have tasks for, turn off the task instance-based authorization by specifying a configuration setting in the appropriate 100Custom.xml file in your topology.

Dojo is an open source set of JavaScript libraries that enhance the capabilities of native JavaScript. The Dojo Toolkit is supplied and loaded by Coach pages.
