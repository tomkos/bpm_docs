# Troubleshooting and problem determination

## About this task

- Track license usage for IBM Integration Designer

As you use IBM Integration Designer, license usage data is collected. If you have the IBM License Metric Tool installed, you can use this data to ensure you adhere to your license agreement.
- Performance tuning for IBM Integration Designer

If an application fails to run or cycles for a long time without completing, those situations might be caused by insufficient system memory.
- Fixing the CWSCA9523E error so you can use HTTPS to call a REST endpoint

When you use HTTPS to call a REST endpoint, you might see the error CWSCA9523E: The SSL settings are missing on the import in the Problems.
- Fixing compilation errors in integration projects

Refactoring artifacts in IBM Process Designer sometimes causes compilation errors to appear in IBM Integration Designer. These errors occur after you refresh Integration Designer from the repository.
- Resolving connection problems in Integration Designer

In Integration Designer, you can occasionally encounter problems in connecting to a UTE server or connecting to a process application server or IBM Process Center. In most situations, you can resolve these problems and establish successful connections.
- Error prevention as part of application design

Including error prevention practices as part of your application design means implementing specific design techniques and using the capabilities of the product to help prevent system and application errors.
- Using the Server Logs view for problem determination

In IBM Integration Designer, the Server Logs view is used to display the contents of server consoles and log files. It automatically displays console output for each server that is started, but you can also manually load and display the contents of the console and log files for any server. If you enable cross-component tracing, the Server Logs view will also display invocation records that can contain the invocation data that passed between components. The Server Logs view provides several advantages over the traditional Console view, such as the ability to filter records and display invocation records in hierarchical format.
- Using the integration debugger for problem determination

In IBM Integration Designer, you can debug modules and several kinds of business integration components using the integration debugger. These components include visual snippets, business object data maps, business processes, state machines, mediation flows, business rule sets, and decision tables. You can also debug XML maps, but you can only debug them within the workspace and not on a server.
- Deploying case solution fails with NullPointerException

When deploying the case solution snapshot by using REST API, the deployment fails with NullPointerException and the following error is displayed:
