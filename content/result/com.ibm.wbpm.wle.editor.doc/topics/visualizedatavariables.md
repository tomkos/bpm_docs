# Visualize BPD data variables (deprecated)

## Procedure

1. Open a business process definition (BPD) in IBM® Process
Designer.
2. Click the Data Visualization button
in the upper right corner. Alternatively, click Playback > Visualize Process to view the
data visualization diagram. The data visualization
diagram opens in a new web browser window.
3. Select Data from the drop-down list
in the selection area on the left side in the browser window. Under Variable,
click Inputs, Outputs,
or Private and select the input, output, or
private variables that you want to visualize on the activities in
the diagram on the right side. Variables are displayed
as colored icons in the diagram. The activities in the selected BPD
that have the same variables are represented by icons of the same
color. Up to three icons are displayed on either side of each activity.
4. Click the down arrow spinners below the third icon on either
side to display the next three icons. Click the up arrow spinners
on either side to view the earlier icons.
5. Click any colored icon to slide and display the labels
that contain the actual variable names for all same-color icons.
6. Click a subprocess within a process in the diagram to visualize
that subprocess. The input and output variables are
global to the process; if you browse into a subprocess the same variables
are displayed. Private variables can be defined on the main process
and the subprocesses inherit them. However, private variables defined
on a subprocess are visible only to that particular subprocess.
7. Click the Minimize button on the left side to hide the
variables list and view only the data visualization diagram. Use the
zoom in or zoom out bar in the upper right corner to enlarge or reduce
the diagram view in the browser window.
