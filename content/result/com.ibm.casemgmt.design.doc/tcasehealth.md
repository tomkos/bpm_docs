# Enabling or disabling case health analysis

## Before you begin

If you installed Business Automation Workflow
from scratch, or you upgraded from a previous version of Business Automation Workflow or IBM Business Automation
Workflow that did not have the case
health analysis feature installed, you can install the case health analysis feature by running the
Configure the Case Management Object Stores
task for the target object stores in your environment.
For information about using the case configuration tool to run tasks, see
the topics Preparing to run the case configuration tasks and Preparing to run the configuration tasks.

When the case health analysis feature is installed by running the Configure the Case Management Object Stores task in Business Automation Workflow V19.0.0.1 and later, the
feature is disabled by default.

## About this task

If you upgraded to Business Automation Workflow from a previous version of Business Automation Workflow or IBM Business Automation
Workflow that had the case health
analysis feature installed, the upgrade retained the feature and preserved its existing settings.
For example, if the case health analysis feature was enabled in the previous version of Business Automation Workflow or IBM Business Automation
Workflow, it is still enabled in the
upgraded version of Business Automation Workflow.

## Procedure

To enable or disable case health analysis:

1. Log into Administrator Console for Content Engine (ACCE).
2. Navigate to Target OS > Sweep Management > Sweep Policies > Custom Policy > Case Health
Analysis Sweep Policy.
3. Depending on whether you want to enable or disable case health analysis, either select or clear
the Enabled check box.
