<h1>Toolbar widget</h1>

<p>The buttons and menu buttons that are included
by default in the Toolbar widget depend on the type of page that the
widget is on. You can edit the settings for the Toolbar widget to
add, remove, and edit the buttons and menu buttons that are available
to case workers.</p>

<h2>IBMÂ® Business Automation</h2>

<p>Workflow pages that include this
widget by default</p>

<ul>
<li>Add Case</li>
<li><p>Manage Roles</p></li>
<li><p>Toolbar widget events</p></li>
</ul>

<p>No events are defined specifically for the Toolbar widget. However, the Toolbar widget does publish events if certain actions are configured for the widget. For example, if the Add Case action is configured for the Toolbar widget, the widget publishes the Open new case page event for that action..</p>
