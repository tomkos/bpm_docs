| Single Cluster                                    |                    1 | Messaging, application deployment target, and application support functions are contained in a single cluster. This topology pattern is useful for synchronous messaging, proof of concept, or application testing environments.A Single Cluster topology pattern is ideal for limited hardware. Because all of the components are installed in the same cluster, fewer physical machines are required. | Supported by the following products: IBM Business Automation Workflow Enterprise IBM Business Automation Workflow Express |
| Application, Remote Messaging, and Remote Support |                    3 | This topology pattern defines one cluster for application deployment, one remote cluster for the messaging infrastructure, and one remote cluster for supporting applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Supported by the following products: IBM Business Automation Workflow Enterprise IBM Business Automation Workflow Express |
