# Reusing assets from workflow centers

From the search results, you can
navigate to the asset that you searched for, read its documentation,
open it in the appropriate tool, and subscribe to the toolkit or process
application that contains the asset that you want to use.

The
search looks for the text entered in the asset name, description or
documentation, type, and tags. If you register other workflow centers,
you can run a search for assets that are part of the registered process
center. After the search results are returned, you can subscribe to
the toolkit or process application that you want to use.

## Before you begin

## Procedure

To reuse assets from workflow centers, complete the following
steps:

1. From the search results, select the asset, click Open
in Designer or Open in workspace.
2. Click Subscribe. The Open
in Designer or the Open in workspace option
becomes available for the associated assets that you subscribed to.
