# Organizing library items in smart folders

## About this task

- The Changed today and Changed this week folders
include all library items in the current process application or toolkit that were changed on the
current day or in the current week. They include library items changed by all users who have access
to the current project.
- The Favorites folder includes all the items in the current process
application or toolkit and its dependencies that you mark as a favorite (by clicking the star icon
next to the item name in the library or by adding the Favorite tag). This way
you can quickly identify and access important or most frequently-used items from a single
location.
- The Public folder includes all the items in the current process
application or toolkit and its dependencies to which you have assigned the
Public tag.Important: To view the items under the
Public smart folder, ensure that you update the System Data Toolkit to System
Data Toolkit 8.0 or later.

You can create custom smart folders that are private or you can let
authorized users, anyone who has access to the current process application or toolkit, view their
contents.

## Procedure

Complete the following steps to create a custom smart folder:

1. In Process Designer, open the process
application or toolkit, and click the plus sign next to Smart Folders in the
library.
2. Enter the name, and specify the criteria, such as the tag and the modified date, to determine
which library items to include. Optionally, you can choose to show the number of items, allow all
authorized users to view the content, and include items from toolkit dependencies.

Process Designer evaluates the criteria from the
beginning to the end. If no criteria match existing library items, the smart folder is empty.
3. Click Finish to save the smart folder settings.
