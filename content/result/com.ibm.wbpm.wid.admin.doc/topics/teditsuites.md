# Editing test suites

## About this task

- Opening the test suite editor

When you create a new test suite using the Create Component Test Suite wizard, the new test suite will automatically open in the test suite editor as soon as you click Finish in the wizard. However, you can manually open any test suite in the test suite editor from the Business Integration view.
- Adding descriptions to test suites

By default, a test suite has no description associated with it. However, you can add a description to your test suite to help describe its purpose or contents.
- Creating and managing test cases

In addition to enabling you to manage test suites, the test suite editor also enables you to precisely manage the individual test cases that consist of your test suites. For example, you can create test variations for your test cases and add invocation steps and Wait On steps as required.
- Editing the test configuration

In the test suite editor, you can edit the test configuration and customize it for specific tests. For example, you can add modules to the test configuration or add emulators or monitors to a module in the test configuration.
