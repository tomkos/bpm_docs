# Adding nodes to diagrams by using the keyboard in the Process Designer

## About this task

## Procedure

To add nodes to a diagram by using the keyboard, complete
the following steps:

1. Open the web editor that you want to work with.
2. In the Diagram view, ensure that the focus is on the canvas, and then
press the Q key (without pressing the Shift
key).
If necessary, use the Tab key to bring the focus back to the canvas.
The Quick Add window opens.
3 To view the available node types, press Ctrl and the space bar at the sametime for content assistance. From the list, select the node that you want to add and clickAdd . You can also add nodes in the following ways:
    - To add multiple nodes, enter the node types that you want to add, separate the nodes types by
pressing Enter, and then click Add.
    - To specify a name for a node that you are about to add, you can enter the node type and name in
the format <node\_type>:<node\_name>.
    - To add more nodes of the same type to the diagram, add more entries of the same type to the
list. For example, to add three different services to a client-side human service diagram, add three
service entries to the list. After the services are added to the canvas, you can update the
properties in the Properties view of each service.
    - You can paste a list of nodes into the window, for
exampleScript:Initialize variables
Activity:Enter data
Script:Validate data
    - For an entry that does not match any listed node types, a client-side script is added to the
client-side human services diagram and a user task activity is added to a process.
4. In the Properties view of each newly
added node, update the node name and its properties as required.
5. Click Save or Finish Editing.
