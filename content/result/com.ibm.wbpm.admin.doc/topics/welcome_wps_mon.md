# Monitoring system performance

- Service component monitoring overview

A conceptual overview of the reasons you monitor service components, of which event points within the service components you select to monitor, and how to configure monitoring on your system.
- Enabling and configuring service component monitoring

To be able to monitor service components, you must first enable the monitoring capabilities. Then you must specify the events you want to monitor, the information you want to capture from the event, and the method used to publish the results.
- Viewing monitored events

There are a number of ways for you to view the published results of your monitored events, depending on the type of monitoring you are using. This section presents methods that you can use to view performance data, event logs, and service component events stored on a Common Event Infrastructure database.
