# Adding a step to assign workgroup members

## Before you begin

## Procedure

To add a step to assign workgroup members:

1. Add a lane for the new step.
Do not create a
workgroup lane for the workgroup that must be assigned. This step
must be completed by users who are assigned to a role or by users
who are assigned to a workgroup that already has members. That is,
there must be a known user who can complete this step.
The case worker is prompted to assign a user or group
to the workgroup when the work item is opened from the in-basket.
2. Add a step to the lane.
3. In the Step Properties section, select a workgroup from
the list.
4. Ensure that Read and Write is selected.
5. Click OK.
