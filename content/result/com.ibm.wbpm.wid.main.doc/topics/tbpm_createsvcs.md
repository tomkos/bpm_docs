# Creating services

Services provide functions for a business process, which
itself is a sequence of services. Creating services separately from
a business process means a service can be developed independently
of a business process and that many types of business processes can
reuse that service.

## About this task

To bring a service into a business process, you use an
import. To make a service available to business processes, you use
an export.

- web services - Services that are offered over the Internet
- adapter-based services - Services that make enterprise data from
large back end systems like DB2 and SAP accessible
- messaging services - Services that provide data from messaging
systems like WebSphere MQ
- Enterprise JavaBeans - Services that are derived from Enterprise
JavaBeans (EJBs)
- registries - Manage services in organizations
- data handlers - Used for services that require unique and uncommon
data formats
- mediation flows - Intervene dynamically between services to transform,
route or augment data.
