# Working with adapters

With the help of an adapter, the application and EIS can communicate, sending and retrieving
information in a consistent way. To allow your applications to operate as services, the adapter
connects them to IBM Business Automation Workflow, which powers your
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). With an adapter, you no longer need to provide proprietary
connection utilities (or write custom connection utilities) for each EIS or application server.

- Differences between WebSphere Adapters and WebSphere Business Integration Adapters

Both WebSphere Adapters and WebSphere Business Integration Adapters mediate communication between components and enterprise information systems. The two types of adapter differ in several respects including: their integration, their JCA-compliance, their data models, and the management of their connectivity.
- WebSphere adapters

WebSphere adapters, also known as resource adapters, enable managed, bidirectional connectivity between enterprise information systems (EISs) and Java EE components supported by the server.
- WebSphere Business Integration Adapters

WebSphere Business Integration Adapters consist of a collection of software, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and tools to enable applications to exchange business data through an integration broker.
- WebSphere Business Integration Adapter application use within clusters

WebSphere Business Integration Adapter module applications can be used within a cluster under certain conditions. Clusters are used to provide scalability and availability to your applications in a network deployment environment.
