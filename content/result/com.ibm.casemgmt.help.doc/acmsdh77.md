# To-do tasks

You specify that a to-do task is required for the case to complete or that it is optional. You
also specify whether the task is started automatically or when a user adds the task in the Case Client.

You can hide tasks from view in the case client. For example, if you have tasks that have no
value to the case worker, you can mark those tasks as hidden when you design your solution.
Typically hidden tasks are controlled programmatically through business logic that is built into the
case management application.

To-do tasks are displayed in the To-Do List widget.
