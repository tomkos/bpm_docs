# Process documentation location links (deprecated)

You might need to provide a link to an artifact, such as a business
process definition (BPD), outside of IBM Business Automation
Workflow.
For example, you might want to email the IBM Workflow
Center location
of a BPD or a process application. Perhaps you might need to share
a link to an artifact within another artifact, such as by sharing
a link to a process application in the documentation of another process
application.
