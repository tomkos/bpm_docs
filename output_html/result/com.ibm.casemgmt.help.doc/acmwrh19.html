<h1>Classic pages</h1>

<p>The page title and layout can be modified using the Page Options tool on the Page Editor screen.
The flow of events is achieved either by widgets that broadcast events or by widgets that are wired
to other widgets on the page. You might configure your application so that each case activity has
its own page. For example, you might require that a loan officer must create and submit loan
requests and notify customers when a decision is reached. So you add a page to create and submit
loan requests. You then create a separate page with work items to contact customers with the status
of their loan requests. In addition, you might configure the application so that different roles use
different pages.</p>

<p>An HTML template defines the layout and widget configuration for a page. A JavaScript file
contains the Dojo classes and workflow JavaScript classes that handle the processing that is
required for the page. A JSON file contains the definitions for wired events and any disabled
broadcast events.</p>
