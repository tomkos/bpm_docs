# Service types in the desktop Process Designer
(deprecated)

The type of service that you choose to create depends upon the
requirements of the activity. For example, if an activity requires
integration with an external system, such as a database, you can create
an integration service. If an activity requires that call center personnel
enter data about customer requests, you can create a client-side human
service with a coach.

The following types of services can be modeled in the desktop Process Designer:

| Service type                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | See...                                       |

| Ajax service                                         | Use an Ajax service when you want to include a control in a coach to implement dynamic data selection such as automatically populating drop-down lists and automatically completing edit boxes. An Ajax service can pull data dynamically from a connected data source, such as a database. You cannot call an Ajax service from other types of services, but an Ajax service can call other nested services.                                                              | Building an Ajax service                     |
| Decision service                                     | Use a Decision service when you want a condition to determine the implementation invoked. For example, when a certain condition evaluates to true, Business Automation Workflow implements the JavaScript expression that you provide. Decision services cannot include Java™ or Web Service integrations directly. You can call a Decision service from any other type of service and a decision service can call other nested services.                                  | Building a Decision service                  |
| Integration service                                  | Use an Integration service when you want to integrate with an external system. An Integration service is the only type of service that can contain a Java or Web Service integration. You can call an Integration service from any other type of service and an Integration service can call other nested services.                                                                                                                                                        | Building an Integration service              |
| Advanced Integration service                         | Use an Advanced Integration service when you want to integrate with a service created in IBM® Integration Designer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Building an Advanced Integration service     |
| IBM Business Automation Workflow Integration service | Use an IBM Business Automation Workflow Integration service when you want to integrate with an IBM Business Automation Workflow server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Integrating BPDs with IBM Case Manager cases |
| General System service                               | Use a General System service when you need to coordinate other nested services or you need to manipulate variable data. For example, if you need to implement data transformations or generate HTML for a coach, you can use a General System service. General System services cannot include Java or Web Service integrations directly. You can call a General System service from any other type of service and a General System service can call other nested services. | Building a General System service            |
