# Security considerations

Server security, including administrative security and application security, is automatically
enabled for those test environment servers that you choose to install with IBM Integration
Designer
24.0.0.0.

During installation of the test environment you are prompted for
a user name and password to be used for administering server security.

Note that if you disable or enable server security in a server
administrative console, you must ensure that these changes are also
specified for the same server in the server configuration editor or
the Window > Preferences > Server > Security preferences page of IBM Integration
Designer.

Information about changing the user ID and password, and about disabling or enabling server
security, is found in the Security documentation in the IBM Integration
Designer help: Help > Help Contents. The embedded assistance help opens. Navigate to IBM Business Process Manager, Version 8.5, All platforms > Authoring services in Integration Designer > Managing security in IBM Integration Designer.
