# State machines

State machines are a common way of showing a set of interrelated
states in a process. A familiar state machine is a drink dispenser.
You put some coins into the machine, and along with your drink, you
get your exact change. The state machine mechanically calculates the
value of the coins that you inserted and the coins that must be returned
to you. In the following diagram, a typical state machine is shown
as created by the state machine editor. In the state machine, an item
is purchased and shipped to a customer.
