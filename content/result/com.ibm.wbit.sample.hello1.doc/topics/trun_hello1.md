# Run the sample

After you have finished building the sample, you can run
it.

To run the sample, complete the following steps:

- Deploy the mediation module.
- Test the mediation module.

- Deploy the modules to the server

You must deploy (also referred to as publish) your modules to your test environment server before you can run and test your mediation.
- Test the module

The next task is to run and test the module you just deployed. You will use the integration test client to test the module by giving it sample data and viewing the result.
- Remove the modules from the server

Generally, when you have finished testing a module, you should remove it from the server. This will ensure that the only modules that are deployed to the server are those that you are preparing to test, which will reduce the load on the server and enhance its performance.
