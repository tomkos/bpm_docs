# Enabling processes for tracking and reporting

- Tracking IBM Business Automation Workflow performance data

To create customized and third-party reports in Business Automation Workflow, you identify the data to track and send that data to the Performance Data Warehouse.
- Sending tracking definitions to Performance Data Warehouse

 Traditional: 
To track performance data, you need to send tracking definitions to the Performance Data Warehouse. Each time you update your tracking requirements in IBM Process Designer, you must send the updated definitions to Performance Data Warehouse.
- Exposing performance scoreboards

The performance scoreboards are not exposed by default. If you want to expose them to your Process Portal users, you must complete some manual steps.
- Defining reports in Process Designer (deprecated)

Reports enable you to analyze business data that is specific to your processes. You can specify the variables to track and define the report to query your tracked data. Users can view the resulting report scoreboards in Process Portal. Instead of using the deprecated reporting capabilities, consider using dashboards that you design in coaches.
