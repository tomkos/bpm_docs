# Deploying the WTX map

The WTX map is deployed with the application module that uses the WTX data
binding. The default location to add the map is in a directory called WTX
located at the top level in the module.

This location can be overridden by setting the XMLToNative Map Name and
NativeToXML Map Name properties in the resource configuration of the WTX data
binding.
