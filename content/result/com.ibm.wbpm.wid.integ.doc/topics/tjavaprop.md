# Creating Java code in
a custom mediation primitive

## Before you begin

## Procedure

1. In the Mediation Flow editor, add the custom mediation
primitive to the canvas, and wire the input and output terminals.
2. Select the custom mediation primitive on the canvas to
view its properties. In the properties view, click the Details tab.
3. Choose Visual to create a visual
snippet, or Java to create a Java snippet.

## Results

- Switching between a Java snippet
and a visual snippet may cause the existing implementation to be lost.
- Do not edit the generated Java files,
as they will be overwritten when the mediation flow is saved.
