# Working with IBM Installation
Manager

## About this task

- Overview

IBM Installation Manager is a program that helps you install the IBM Integration Designer packages on your workstation. It also helps you update, modify, and uninstall this and other packages that you install. A package can be a product, a group of components, or a single component that is designed to be installed by the Installation Manager.
- Silently installing and uninstalling Installation Manager

IBM Installation Manager can be silently installed and uninstalled.
- Package groups and the shared resources directory

When you install the IBM Integration Designer package using IBM Installation Manager, you must choose a shared resources directory (if IBM Integration Designer is the first product to be installed using Installation Manager) and a package group.
- Setting repository preferences in Installation Manager

If you start Installation Manager directly (for example from a repository located on a web server), you must specify the URL for the directory that contains the product package in Installation Manager before you can install the product package.
