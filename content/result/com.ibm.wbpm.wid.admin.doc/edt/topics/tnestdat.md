# Adding child extended data elements in event definitions

In event definitions, you can add extended data elements
as nested children under existing extended data elements. This enables
you to use extended data elements to convey business data that is
stored in a hierarchal structure, such as typically found in a business
object.

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Open your event definition in the event definition editor.
2. In the event definition, ensure that a data type of noValue is specified
for your intended parent extended data element. This is a requirement if you want to add a child
extended data element.
Information about specifying the data type of an extended data element is found in the topic
"Specifying data types of extended data
elements."
3. In the event definition, select the extended data element
to which you want to add a nested child extended data element.
4. Click the Add Extended Data as Nested Child icon . A default
child extended data element is added under the parent extended data
element. You can add as
many child extended data elements as you want and nest them as deeply
under the parent extended data element as you need.
