# Activating snapshots for use with Process Portal

## Before you begin

By default, you log in to the Workflow Center in Basic mode, which
offers access to simplified views. To gain access to advanced views in the Workflow Center and to perform
administrative actions, such as managing connections, users, user groups, and permissions, you must
be in the Advanced mode.

To change the view mode, click your user name in the landing page toolbar, select
Preferences, and use the slider to select the mode that you need. For more
information, see Workflow Center.

## About this task

Note that only the process is activated when you activate a process application. If the
process application uses BPEL processes and the associated templates were stopped (as described in
Administering BPEL process and task templates), follow the instructions in that section to
start the templates.

On Workflow Center, the user can activate
and deactivate snapshots if they are a repository admin, a project admin, or has project write
permissions. On Workflow Server the user can activate and deactivate snapshots if the user is a system admin.

## Procedure

1. In Workflow Center, select the Process Apps or Toolkits tab.
2. Click Details to select the process application or toolkit for
which you want to activate a snapshot. If multiple tracks exist, click the
Snapshot tab and select the track that you want from the drop-down
menu.
3. Find the snapshot that you want, and then click Activate from the
context menu (). Once you activate the snapshot, confirm that
the snapshot's status is Active.
