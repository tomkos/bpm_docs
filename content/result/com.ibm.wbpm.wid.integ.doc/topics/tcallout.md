# Invoking a service by using a callout

A callout is used to send a processed message to the operation.
The callout can only be used at the end of the request flow and its
returned message is caught by a Callout Response primitive in the
response flow.

1. Right-click the node and select Show Properties. Then click Details
and the view shows up. Note the Reference Name and Operation Name
which were selected when creating the callout node.
2 The properties which can be changed are summarized in the tablebelow.Table 1. Callout node property description Property Description Possible Values Reference Name The reference of the service that is calledby the callout Operation Name The name of the operation called by the callout Use dynamic endpoint if set in the message header Determines if the TargetAddress header shouldbe used to override the endpoint if present. If set to True and if the TargetAddress headeris populated, message is forwarded. Otherwise the message proceedsnormally. Default: true Async Timeout Specifies time to wait for a responses whenperforming an asynchronous deferred response invocation. If timeout occurs, the fail terminal is fired. This is treatedas an unmodeled fault with regard to retry conditions. Default :5 Note: Async Timeout is only effective when the invocation styleused for a Callout is Async with deferred response. Require mediation flow to wait for service responsewhen the flow component is invoked asynchronously with callback Determines if the call should be forced to actin a synchronous manner. Boolean: true or false Default: false Note: Thisoption is only available with Async (Compatibility) and Default (Compatibility)invocation styles. Invocation Style Determines whether the service is invoked synchronouslyor asynchronously. Sync, Async (deferred), Async (callback),Async one way, Default (Compatibility), Async (Compatibility), Astarget Default: As target Retry On Determines whether and how fault responses affectretry. Default: Never Retry Count Number of retry attempts following initial failurebefore a modeled fault, timeout or fail terminal is fired. The number must be an integer greater thanor equal to 0. Default: 0 Retry Delay Sets the delay between retry attempts, in seconds. Must be an integer greater than or equalto 0. If 0, there will be no delay between attempts meaning they willrun as fast as the server can handle them. Default: 0 Try Alternate Endpoints Determines if any alternate endpoints shouldbe used on retries. This function is only available if 'Use dynamic endpoint'is also True. Default: True

In certain situations, such as input error detected, you may want
to return the message immediately without invoking the callout. In
this case you can use the input response node. This will bypass the
flow and return the message to the source.
