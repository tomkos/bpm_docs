# Searching for Workflow Center assets

You can find assets, such as toolkits, process applications, case solutions, services, or
business objects faster using specific syntax or tags.

The search looks for the text that
is entered in the asset name, description or documentation, type,
and tags. To identify reusable assets, you can use the Public tag.
For more information, see Tagging library items in the
related tasks section.

When the asset is found, you can read
the documentation for it or open it using the appropriate tool. Then
you can reuse these assets on a local or registered Workflow Center.

| [field name]: <search text>                | Search for text in a specific asset field: displayName, name, description, tags, and type.Note: The display names and names of process applications and toolkits are not identical. For process applications and toolkits the displayName is the name of the asset and the name is an acronym.                                       | To search for an asset with the name that starts with the term Business\_, use the displayName:Business\_ search query. To search for a particular component, such as a Business Process Diagram, that starts with the term Business\_, use the type:"Business Process Diagram" displayName:Business\_ search query.  Note: The search is performed for the text that directly precedes the field name entered. Therefore, unless the terms are surrounded by double quotation marks, when you search for name:Do it right, the search returns results that include Do in the name field. The rest of the text is matched with other default fields and results are returned accordingly. |
| <search text>AND<search text>              | The Boolean AND operator matches assets that have both terms anywhere in the searchable fields. By default, when two terms are entered in the search field, the AND criteria is included.

- Reusing assets from workflow centers

From the search results, you can navigate to the asset that you searched for, read its documentation, open it in the appropriate tool, and subscribe to the toolkit or process application that contains the asset that you want to use.
