# Connecting a user registry

- The users are local to the User Management Service and are therefore
unknown in a connected IBM Business Automation Workflow system.
- basicRegistry supports only two attributes for users: username
and password. However, there are situations in which a connected system
might need to retrieve the userâ€™s full name.
- basicRegistry does not support nesting of groups.

Next, perform Creating User Management Service server clones.
