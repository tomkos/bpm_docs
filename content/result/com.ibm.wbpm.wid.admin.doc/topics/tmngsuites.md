# Managing test suites

## About this task

- Creating component test projects

Before you can create one or more test suites, you must create a component test project to contain them.
- Creating component test suites

A component test suite is a container for one or more test cases. When you create a test suite, you can choose to initially create it without any test cases and then later define some test cases for it. Or, you can choose to create the test suite and simultaneously define some test cases for it by selecting either operation-level testing or scenario-based testing. If you choose operation-level testing, a test case is generated for each selected operation. If you choose scenario-based testing, a single test case is generated for all of the selected operations.
- Editing test suites

Using the test suite editor, you can edit test suites in a variety of ways. For example, you can add one or more test cases to a test suite and then modify them by adding test variations, invocation steps, or Wait On steps.
