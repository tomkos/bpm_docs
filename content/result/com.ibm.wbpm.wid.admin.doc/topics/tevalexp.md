# Evaluating expressions in the integration debugger

## Before you begin

- Detail pane of the Expressions view
- Java editor when it is displaying source and
it is not read-only

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Select the stack frame in which an evaluation is to be
performed. For the detail pane of the Expressions view, the evaluation
context will be a selected variable. If no variable is selected, the
selected stack frame will be the context.
2. Select the expression to be evaluated and select Display, Inspect or Execute from
the context   menu. The result of a Display or Inspect evaluation
is shown in the Expressions view. Note that Execute does
not display a result. The expression is just run.
