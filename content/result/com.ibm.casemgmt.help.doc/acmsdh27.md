# Creating routes in a workflow

## Procedure

To create a route in a workflow:

1. Click the Add connectors between steps icon.
2. Click the first step in the route.
3. Drag your mouse to the second step in the route.
A connector is added between the two steps. The arrowhead
on the connector indicates the direction that the route takes from
step to step and the order of the steps.
4. Optional: 
Select the connector and then specify
properties for the connector.
If the start step was configured
with responses, you can associate a response with the connector. The
response is displayed for the connector label in the canvas.

- Splitting and joining an activity route

Most workflows require branching at various points as the result of a response made by a participant. You use a split to start the branching and a join to bring the work back into a single path at the end of all the true routes.
- Route validation rules for a workflow

The steps and routing in a workflow must be valid before you can deploy the solution. When you are connecting steps, follow the route validation rules to ensure that your workflow is valid without route errors.
- Sample routes for a workflow

Routes between the steps in a workflow definition specify how work progresses from one step to the next.
