The values for an attribute are maintained using one of the following methods:

- The Process Admin Console (by selecting User management > Bulk User
Attribute Assignment)
- REST APIs (a bulk version of
/rest/bpm/wle/v1/user/a?action=setPreference&key=...&value=...)
- JS APIs

Some customers and business partners have built tools to synchronize user attributes from various
outside sources into the database for use in different contexts. In many instances, only the
predefined attributes are used â€“ especially email address. However, organizations could also
replicate elements from an external registry into the database.

For example, custom portal implementations could use this approach for personalization by storing
user preferences like startPage or preferredLanguage in user attributes.

- server/user-attributes/rest-authorization/public-attribute
- server/user-attributes/rest-authorization/self-manageable-attribute

- Can only see attributes of themselves and other users listed as public-attribute
- Can only see and update own attributes listed as self-manageable-attribute

```
<server>
<user-attributes merge="mergeChildren">
<rest-authorization merge="mergeChildren">
<self-manageable-attribute merge="append">CustomAttribute</self-manageable-attribute>
</rest-authorization>
</user-attributes>
</server>
```
