# Reinvoking operations

## About this task

## Procedure

1. In the integration test client, click the Events tab.
The Events page opens.
2 In the Events area, complete one of the following activities:
    - If you want to reinvoke an operation and specify new values
for any manual Emulate event, right-click the Invoke event for the
operation and select Rerun. If no manual emulator
is encountered, the test will run to completion and a Stopped event
will be displayed in the Events area. However, if a manual emulator
is encountered, the test will pause so that you can specify a new
set of values. A manual Emulate event will also be displayed in the
Events area. Information about specifying values is found in the topic
"Specifying values for an operation."
    - If you want to reinvoke an operation and specify the same
values for any manual Emulate event, right-click the Invoke event
for the operation and select Rerun with Auto Emulate.
The test will run to completion and a Stopped event will be displayed
in the Events area.
