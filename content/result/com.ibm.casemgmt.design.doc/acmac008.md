names, and the task configuration XML file names that are affected by the task options.

Specifies the configuration XML file to encrypt the passwords
for. You can omit the -taskfile task\_file\_name parameter
if you want to store passwords for all the tasks or if you specify
the -task task\_type parameter.

If
you omit the -task task\_type parameter
and the -taskfile task\_file\_name parameter,
you are prompted to enter the passwords for each configuration XML
file in the profile. Each password is encrypted before it is added
to the XML file. The passwords that you enter depend on the type of
profile, which is described in Table 1.

See Table 2 for the valid task\_file\_name values
and passwords.

- The name of the profile, such as develop1. The profile is located in the
install\_root/CaseManagement/configure/profiles directory.
install\_root is the location where IBM Business Automation
Workflow is installed.
- The full path to the profile directory, such as
"install\_root\CaseManagement\configure\profiles\develop1" or
/install\_root/CaseManagement/configure/profiles/develop1.
- The full path to the profile input file, such as
"install\_root\CaseManagement\configure\profiles\develop1\develop1.cfgp"
or
/install\_root/CaseManagement/configure/profiles/develop1/develop1.cfgp.
