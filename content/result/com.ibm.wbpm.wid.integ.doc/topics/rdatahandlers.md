# Data handlers

In effect, data handlers allow you to customize
a data format transformation for your particular needs. Data handlers
are reusable transformation logic independent of a specific transport
protocol, which means you can create a data handler and use it with
JMS, MQ, HTTP, EIS and other bindings. Data handlers can be invoked
from data bindings and Javaâ„¢ components.

To
learn how to create a data handler, see data handler.

To learn how to add a data handler to a data
format transformation, see Creating a data format transformation resource configuration.
