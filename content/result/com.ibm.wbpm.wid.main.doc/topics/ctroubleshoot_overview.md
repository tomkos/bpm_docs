# Problem determination overview

Troubleshooting is the process of finding and eliminating
the cause of a problem. Here are some techniques you can use to try
to resolve problems with using your IBMÂ® software.

Whenever you have a problem with your IBM software,
the troubleshooting process begins as soon as you ask yourself what
happened? A basic troubleshooting strategy at a high level involves
several steps:

1. Recording the symptoms
2. Recreating the problem
3. Eliminating possible causes
4. Using diagnostic tools

## Recording the symptoms of the problem

Depending
on the type of problem you have, whether it be with your application,
your server, or your tools, you might receive a message that indicates
something is wrong. Always record the error message that you see.
As simple as this sounds, error messages often contain codes that
make more sense as you investigate your problem further. You might
also receive multiple error messages that look similar, but have subtle
differences. By recording the details of each one you can learn more
about where your problem exists.

- Problems view in the Workbench
- Console in the Workbench
- Log files in your workspace (look for *.log files in your workspace
metadata directory)
- Error windows

## Recreating the problem

- How did you first notice the problem?
- Did you do anything different that made you notice the problem?
- Is the process that is causing the problem a new procedure, or
has it worked successfully before?
- If this process worked before, what has changed? The change can
refer to any type of change made to the system, ranging from adding
new hardware or software, to configuration changes you might have
made to existing software.
- What was the first symptom of this problem that you witnessed?
Were there other symptoms occurring around that time?
- Does the same problem occur elsewhere? Is only one machine experiencing
the problem or are multiple machines experiencing the same problem?
- What messages are generated that can indicate what the problem
is?

## Eliminating possible causes

- Has anyone else experienced this problem? See the topic Searching knowledge bases (web search).
- Is there a fix you can apply? See the topic Getting fixes.

## Using the debugging tool for application development

As
a more advanced task, you can use the debugger to help you debug applications.
To learn how to use the tool, see the following topic: Component debugging
