<h1>Deploying a solution with Business Automation Workflow</h1>

<p>You use different ways to deploy a solution depending on the type of
server to which you are deploying the solution.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using a Workflow Center
development profile environment, deploy promoted case solution projects by using Workflow Center.
You can deploy legacy case solutions by using legacy Case Builder or Case administration client.</li>
<li><p>If you are using a Workflow Server production profile
environment, you can install a solution by using Workflow Center or the command line for offline installation. You can deploy legacy case
solutions by using Case administration client.</p></li>
