- CWLAU0001E

The interface map component "0" has either zero or more than one reference.
- CWLAU0002E

The interface map "0" cannot retrieve the ticket from the database (target component: 1 with operation 2).
- CWLAU0003E

The interface map file "0" cannot be loaded.
- CWLAU0004E

The interface map file "0" cannot be loaded. The following exception was thrown: 1.
- CWLAU0005E

The following error occurred with the interface map "0" (source operation "1" and target operation "2") when it invoked the map "3" in the calling context 5.
- CWLAU0006E

The following unexpected exception occurred while using the interface mapping "1" with the source operation "2" and the target operation 3: 0.
- CWLAU0007E

The interface mapping 0 (source method 1, target method 2) caused the following exception while calling the Java snippet 3: 4.
- CWLAU0008E

The interface mapping 0 (source method 1, target method 2) does not recognize the class type "3" when mapping with the Java snippet.
- CWLAU0009E

The interface mapping 0 (source method 1, target method 2) cannot use the parameter type "4" when calling a Java snippet with the class 3.
- CWLAU0010E

The interface mapping 0 (source operation 1, target operation 2) includes the type 3, which is unsupported when running setValue parameter mapping with the value 4.
- CWLAU0011E

The interface mapping 0 (source operation 1, target operation 2) includes the type 3, which is unsupported when running setValue parameter mapping with the part name 4 and the value 5.
- CWLAU0012E

The interface mapping 0 (source operation 1, target operation 2) has an unexpected fault: 3.
- CWLAU0013W

The duplicate key "0" was found during business object transformation or Java snippet mapping.
- CWLAU0014E

The source operation "1" cannot be found in the interface 0.
- CWLAU0015E

The target operation "1" in "0" cannot be found.
- CWLAU0016E

The interface mapping 0 (target reference 1) has multiple wires.
- CWLAU0017E

The interface mapping 0 (source operation 1, target operation 2) has caught an unexpected runtime exception: 3.
- CWLAU0018E
