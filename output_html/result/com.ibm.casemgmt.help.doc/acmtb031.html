<h1>Fields in the Settings pane of the Properties View Designer lose focus in Internet Explorer</h1>

<p>This problem, which occurs only if you are using Case Builder in
Internet Explorer, forces you to place the cursor in the field after you type each character.</p>

<p>To work around this issue, type the value in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, cut and paste
the value into the Name, Collection ID, or
Property ID field in the Settings pane of the
Properties View Designer.</p>
