<h1>Working with case solutions in Case Client</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<ul>
<li>Managing access to cases through roles and case teams</li>
</ul>

<p>To create, modify, or delete a case, you must be a member of a role that has permission to work on cases of that type. In addition, you might need to be assigned as a member or owner of the case team.
- In-baskets</p>

<p>You use an in-basket to view, open, and work with work items assigned to you or others.
- Assigning work</p>

<p>Some user roles are set to reassign work items from one user to another in Case Client. These users can also reassign multiple work items in a single action.
- Adding to favorites and syncing folders and documents</p>

<p>You can create favorites to quickly find the items that you work with frequently. Your favorite items are added to the Favorites view in the web client, also shown as the default Home folder. When you create a favorite, you can optionally choose to sync the item to your workstation or device so that you always have the latest version of the content available.
- Reusing case data</p>

<p>You can use the Split Case action to create a case that reuses data from an existing case. The new case can be the same type as the original case or it can be a different case type.
- Adding new activities for a case</p>

<p>An activity organizes work items that must be completed to process a case. Depending on how your solution is set up, you might be able to add activities to a case in one or more ways.
- Search tips for cases</p>

<p>You can conduct a basic or advanced search. Use the basic search to search across all case types by a case property, such as case ID, case title, or date created. Use advanced search to search for a case within a specific case type or to specify more complex criteria. For example, you can search for cases of a certain type that were added by a specific user between specified dates.
- Search tips for documents</p>

<p>If the repository supports content-based searches, you can search for documents that contain a specified word or phrase. Depending on how the repository is configured, you can also search for documents whose properties contain a specified word or phrase.
