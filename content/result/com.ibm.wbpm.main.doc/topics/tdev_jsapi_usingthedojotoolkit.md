# Using the Dojo Toolkit

## About this task

If you are developing complex
Coach views using Dojo or another JavaScript library and need advanced
features for JavaScript development, debugging, and testing, consider
using an IDE tool, such as RationalÂ® Application
Developer, to initially
create the JavaScript. You can then use the JavaScript that you develop
as part of your Coach views in Process Designer.

## Procedure

1. Open a Coach component.
2. Use Dojo calls. For example, use var x = dojo.byId("name of control"); to return the DOM
node of the control by name.
