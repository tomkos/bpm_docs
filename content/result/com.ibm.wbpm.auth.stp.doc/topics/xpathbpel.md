# Predefined XPath extension functions

In addition to standard XPath functions described in the XPath
1.0 specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath), you can use the
following predefined extension functions in your XPath expressions
and conditions. If these predefined extension functions do not meet
your organization's needs, you can create and define custom extension
functions. For more information, see BPEL processes: Creating custom XPath extension functions.

## XPath extension functions defined by BPEL

The BPEL specification defines the following XPath extension functions,
which are also supported in IBM Workflow
Server.
The namespace for these functions is:  http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/03/business-process/

## XPath extension functions for Business Objects

For easier work with Business Objects, the following functions
are available. The namespace for these functions is:  http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/websphere/wbi/BusinessObject/6.0.0

## Miscellaneous XPath extension functions

Furthermore, there are some extension functions to provide access
to several objects within a BPEL process. The namespace for these
functions is:  http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/websphere/business-process/6.0.0
