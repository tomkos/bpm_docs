| Application server      | websphereapplicationserver.xml | Application server settings that are common to all tasks in the profile. These settings are used when you run any of the tasks for the development environment profile. The properties include the application server installation directory, the administrative user name and password, the port number, cell, and other information about the application server. Each profile contains only one of these files, depending on the application server type. |

The properties include the IBM Content Navigator server installation directory, the administrative user name and password, the port number, cell, and other information about IBM Content Navigator.                                                                             |

## Task files

The task files are generated when you create the profile. For command usage, the argument value
for each task is the name of the XML file without the file extension, for example,
configbox.

| Configure Business Rules                                                                    | configrules.xml              | This task configures the environment to be able to use rules in solutions. Tips:  You can select only one locale in which to write the business rules for your solutions. If you need to create solutions with business rules in other locales, rerun this task to change the rule persistence locale before you create the solution. After the first rule for a solution is saved, the rule persistence locale cannot be changed. If you rerun this task to change the location of the rules repository directory after you deploy any solutions, complete the following steps after you run the task: Stop Content Platform Engine. From the previous rules repository directory, move the res\_data directory to the new location of the rules repository directory. In a cluster environment, the rules directory must be a shared directory that can be accessed by all Content Platform Engine cluster servers. Restart Content Platform Engine. |
| Define the Default Project Area                                                             | definedefaultprojectarea.xml | This task defines the default project area for the development environment. A project area groups solutions in the design object store so that the entire object store is not affected when you reset the test environment. Only users who are assigned to a project area can log on to Case Builder. The default project area is required for each development environment. To create additional project areas and assign users and solutions to a project area, click Tools > Manage Project Areas or use the Case administration client.  Save your changes and run the task to apply your settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
