- Known limitations for translated Business Automation Workflow components

Consider the following known limitations for IBM Business Automation Workflow components translated into national languages.
- Troubleshooting installation and configuration

You can diagnose problems when the installation and configuration of IBM Business Automation Workflow is unsuccessful.
- Troubleshooting migration

If your deployment environment was not migrated successfully, you can take steps to resolve issues.
- Troubleshooting your deployment environment

When processing appears sluggish or requests fail, use a focused approach to determine the source of the problem in the environment. The approach described is for non-standalone server environments.
- Troubleshooting web services

If you have a problem using a web service, use the following troubleshooting resources.
- Troubleshooting high CPU loads on LDAP servers

In some situations, you may experience high CPU loads on a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server connected to an Business Automation Workflow system. To help you identify the CPU-intensive requests, you can audit the information from the LDAP server. It is especially important to check the source IP address to identify the originator of the requests.
- Troubleshooting JVM issues

Best practices for troubleshooting JVM memory and CPU usage issues.
- Troubleshooting NIST SP800-131a environment configurations

If you are configuring IBM Business Automation Workflow to support the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-131a security standard, you might observe one or more of the following configuration issues.
- Troubleshooting 100Custom configuration

The default values for the product with regard to teamworks configuration settings are set during installation. However, these values can be customized by the system administrator after installation. If there is a mistake in the 100custom.xml file, the customization is not applied and it is difficult to find where the problem is.
- Troubleshooting service module deployment failures

This topic describes the steps to take to determine the cause of a problem when deploying a service module. It also presents some possible solutions.
- Desktop Process Designer window is blank (deprecated)

After you log in to the desktop Process Designer, you might see a blank white desktop Process Designer window, a partially displayed view, or an HTTP error. Refresh your browser, or configure additional security in Internet Explorer V8 or V9.
- Logging into web Process Designer using a system ID may result in premature session timeout

If you log into web Process Designer using a system ID like "tw\_admin" or "deAdmin", your browser session may expire before the time limit set for the "LTPA timeout" parameter.
- On the Edge 42 browser, the process playback window blocks content

When using the Microsoft Edge 42 browser in an IBM Business Automation Workflow environment, the process playback window blocks content due to an invalid security certificate. The problem is restricted to processes in the process playback window and does not affect client-side human services.
- Existing Java integration implementations may throw exceptions when using the WebSphere Javamail library

In IBM Business Automation Workflow V18.0.0.1, a new Business Automation Workflow Javamail library was introduced to supplement the older WebSphere Javamail library. If you have an existing Java integration implementation that uses the older WebSphere Javamail library, the implementation may throw exceptions.
- Dashboards cannot be launched in some single sign-on environments

In some single sign-on environments that use a reverse proxy or a gateway server, the Business Automation Workflow dashboard does not render when you launch it. Instead, you see a blank screen. To resolve the problem, use the JVM custom property com.ibm.bpm.dashboard.whitelist to enable the custom dashboard allowlist.
- Troubleshooting a failure to access help topics

By default, IBM Business Automation Workflow is configured to access help topics from the online documentation. If you are working behind a firewall, you might find that links from the product to help files do not resolve. In that case, you need to either revise the proxy settings in the product or download and install the help contents to your local system.
- Troubleshooting problems in migrating a task to a new snapshot

During instance migration, the managers team information in a task is not migrated to a new snapshot if the managers team is provided by a team filter service that is specified in the task assignment. As a result, the snapshot deletion might be blocked.
- File Viewer overlaps Model dialog in Content Management Toolkit Views in Internet Explorer 11
