| Case health after upgradingAfter you upgrade to IBM Case Manager to v5.3.2 or a later release, the "Modified On" and "Modified by" properties on completed and active cases are changed to a service account. The update is also causing more events to be generated in to the object store audit event logs, which may affect performance. IBM Case Manager comes with auditing of events that are associated with changes to a case. More audit event definitions are added to the IBM Case Manager 5.3.x release, if you are upgrading from IBM Case Manager 5.2.x. | To resolve the issue, do the following steps:A. Upgrade to IBM Case Manager v5.3.3 IF004 or later. IBM Case Manager 5.3.3 IF004 and later does not automatically enable the "Case Health Analysis Custom Policy" when the "Configure the Case Management Object Stores" Task is run.  B. Disable the Case Health Analysis Custom Policy that is created and enabled during the Case Manager configuration task during the upgrade (to v5.3.2 or later). Disable the sweep dispatcher at the domain level for IBM FileNet P8 Content Platform Engine. Log in to Content Platform Engine Administration Console (ACCE), go to the domain tab. Scroll to and select the Sweep Subsystem tab Clear the Enable sweeping option Click Save   Upgrade to IBM Case Manager 5.3.2 or later Run the required configuration tasks. Disable the Case Health Analysis Custom Policy on the target object store (TOS) In ACCE, click the relevant TOS to open new tab. Find the Case Health Analysis Custom Policy at the following location: [TOS] > Sweep Management > Sweep Policies > Custom Policies Click Case Health Analysis Custom Policy to open new tab Clear Enable sweep policy Click Save   Re-enable the sweep at the domain level Log in to Content Platform Engine Administration Console (ACCE), go to the domain tab. Scroll to and select the Sweep Subsystem tab Check the Enable sweeping option Click Save  You can choose to enable 'Case Health Analysis Custom Policy' later if you want to use the Case Health feature. Upgrades to future Fix Packs or interim fixes do not affect the configured state of 'Case Health Analysis Custom Policy'. For example, if the policy was disabled during the upgrade to IBM Case Manager 5.3.2, it remains disabled when you upgrade to IBM Case Manager 5.3.3 or later. |
