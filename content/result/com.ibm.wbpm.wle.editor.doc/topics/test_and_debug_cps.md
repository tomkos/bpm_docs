# Running and debugging processes and services in the Inspector

You can use the Inspector to demonstrate current process design and implementation in playback
sessions. Playback sessions help capture important information from different stakeholders, such as
management, users, and business analysts. Taking an iterative approach to process development
ensures that you meet the goals and needs of everyone involved.

You can run your process or service in the Inspector to test your flow and to see whether
individual tasks are running as expected. You can act as different users to test the access that you
set up for your users. If a task does not perform as expected, you can debug it. You can switch
easily between running and debugging your tasks.

To access the Inspector, click  in the lower right of the status bar.

- Run process instances by clicking Run.
- Search for process instances by clicking .

- Running and debugging processes

Run your process in the Inspector to test your flow and to see whether individual tasks are running as expected. You can also act as different users to test the access that you set up for your users. If an activity does not produce expected results, you can debug it to locate the problem and fix it.
- Running and debugging client-side human services in the Inspector

Run your client-side human service to see whether it performs as expected. If errors occur, you can use the debugger to examine each step in the client-side human service.
- Running and debugging service flows

You can develop your service flow as an iterative process that includes several playback sessions. If errors occur, you can debug the service flow in the Inspector.
- Debugging flows by using breakpoints

To investigate what is happening at a particular execution step in a client-side human service or service flow, set a breakpoint where you want the flow to pause. You can then look at the execution state of the flow.
- Restricting access to debugging for services

You might need to limit access to debugging functions in the Inspector. For services other than human services, you can control which users have the ability to debug services. To edit the settings, copy the code snippet and then make the necessary changes.
- Logging in as another user in the Inspector

When you test your process in the Inspector, you might want to act as a different user to see if your task flow is working as expected, or to test the access that you set up for your users. To facilitate testing, the Inspector allows the process creator to perform any task, even if the user is not part of the user group that is authorized to perform the task in Process Portal . The user authentication mode in the Inspector determines whether you run your tasks as the current user, or as another user. The user authentication mode must be set before you run or debug a task. After it is set, the user authentication mode is active for all subsequent tasks.
- Searching for process instances in the Inspector

You can search for and view your previously run and currently running process instances in the Inspector. You can manage running instances and interact with them.
- Inspector reference

You can use the Inspector to run and debug your processes, services and tasks during iterative development.
- Run actions in the Inspector

The actions that are available in the Inspector when you run a process or service in the designer.
- Debug actions in the Inspector

The actions that are available in the Inspector when you debug a flow in the designer.
