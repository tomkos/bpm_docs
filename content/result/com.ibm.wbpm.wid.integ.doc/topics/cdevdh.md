# Developing data handlers

This section shows you how to create your own data handlers specific to
your own needs.

- Data handler authoring

Creating a data handler requires knowledge of the interfaces, types of transformations and configurations.
- Data handler resource configuration

Once you decide either on using a pre-packaged data handler or one that you have created, you need to create a data handler resource configuration with the a wizard in IBMÂ® Integration Designer. This section references the instructions to create the data handler resource configuration.
- Calling data handlers from bindings

As mentioned earlier, data handlers in IBM Workflow Server are not callable from exports or imports directly. This section illustrates how to call data handlers from JMS, MQ and HTTP bindings. It assumes you are familiar with data bindings for JMS, MQ JMS, generic JMS, MQ, and HTTP bindings.
