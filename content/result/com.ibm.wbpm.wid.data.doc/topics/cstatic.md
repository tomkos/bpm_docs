# Static relationships

- There is no managed role allowed as it is not needed for a static mapping.
- The allowed depth of attribute level is infinite.
- Instance data can be predefined within the relationship editor.

The following topics describe how to create and use static relationships in IBMÂ® Integration
Designer:

- Creating static relationships

Static relationships have roles that are based on business objects or on simple data types.
- Pre-populating static relationships

The data for static relationships can be pre-populated.
- Invoking static relationships from maps

There are two ways to invoke a static relationship from maps. You can either call a static relationship from an inbound map or call a static relationship in an outbound map.
