# Binding types

- Selecting appropriate bindings

When you are creating an application, you need to know how to select the binding that is most appropriate to the needs of your application.
- SCA bindings

A Service Component Architecture (SCA) binding lets a service communicate with other services in other modules. An import with an SCA binding lets you access a service in another SCA module. An export with an SCA binding lets you offer a service to other modules.
- Web service bindings

A web service binding is the means of transmitting messages from a Service Component Architecture (SCA) component to a web service (and vice versa).
- HTTP bindings

The HTTP binding is designed to provide Service Component Architecture (SCA) connectivity to HTTP. Consequently, existing or newly-developed HTTP applications can participate in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environments.
- EJB bindings

Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) import bindings enable Service Component Architecture (SCA) components to invoke services provided by Java EE business logic running on a Java EE server. EJB export bindings allow SCA components to be exposed as Enterprise JavaBeans so that Java EE business logic can invoke SCA components otherwise unavailable to them.
- EIS bindings

Enterprise information system (EIS) bindings provide connectivity between SCA components and an external EIS. This communication is achieved using EIS exports and EIS imports that support JCA 1.5 resource adapters and Websphere Adapters.
- JMS bindings

A Java™ Message Service (JMS) provider enables messaging based on the Java Messaging Service API and programming model. It provides JMS connection factories to create connections for JMS destinations and to send and receive messages.
- Generic JMS bindings

The Generic JMS binding provides connectivity to third-party JMS 1.1 compliant providers. The operation of the Generic JMS bindings is similar to that of JMS bindings.
- WebSphere MQ JMS bindings

The WebSphere® MQ JMS binding provides integration with external applications that use a WebSphere MQ JMS-based provider.
- WebSphere MQ bindings

The WebSphere MQ binding provides Service Component Architecture (SCA) connectivity with WebSphere MQ applications.
- Limitations of bindings

The bindings have some limitations in their use that are listed here.
