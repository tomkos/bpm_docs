# Creating an import to call a process

- Creating an import to call a process in an associated module

To call a process from a module, you need an SCA import. You can easily create the import for a module that is associated with a process application or toolkit.
- Creating an import to call a process in a stand-alone module

To call a process from a module, you need an SCA import. Because a stand-alone module is not associated with a process application or toolkit, you must manually create the SCA import and bindings.
