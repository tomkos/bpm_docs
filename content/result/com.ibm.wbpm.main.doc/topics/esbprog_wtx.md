# WebSphere Transformation Extender

- A mediation primitive for running WebSphere TX maps,
called the WTX Map primitive
- A data format transformation for running WebSphere
TX maps called the WTX Data Format Transformation

There are some circumstances in which it is not possible to transform the message to your
required structure using the BO Mapper, Mapping and Data Handler mediation primitives. In these cases WebSphere TX maps can be used to transform the data. WebSphere TX maps can be called using the WTX Map mediation primitive or
by using the WTX Data Format Transformation in a Data Handler mediation primitive or in an Import or
Export.

- Pulling data from sources such as files and queues within a map
- Calling external programs and services from a map
- Splitting and routing batches of messages

- Modelling complex binary or text message formats that Business Objects are unable to model
- Complex validation without having to write code, using component rules on type trees
- Use WebSphere Transformation Extender Industry Packs
to integrate a range of industry standard data formats with your enterprise infrastructure through
predefined type tree templates and maps that the packs provide.
