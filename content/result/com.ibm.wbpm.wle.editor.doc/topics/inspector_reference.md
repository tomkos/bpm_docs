|             1 | Shows the currently active and previously run process instances on the Workflow Center Server or connected Workflow Server in the Process Instances tab. The highlighted instance is the currently selected instance, which means any action you perform or any data shown in the other areas of the Inspector apply to this instance. (The Services in Debug tab becomes active only if you select the Debug icon for a particular task.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|             2 | Use the Instance Name field and the Status drop-down menu to control the list of instances displayed in the Process Instances tab. For example, if you want to see only active process instances that include the word employee in their name, type employee in the Instance Name field and select Active from the Status drop-down menu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|             3 | Use the drop-down lists to choose a different server on which to run the current BPD. You can also choose a different snapshot if you want to run a different version of the BPD. The Process Instances tab includes a Snapshot column so that you know which version of a process the currently displayed instances are running. For example, in the preceding image, the Snapshot column displays Tip to indicate that you are running the version of the process currently under development in the Designer. Remote Workflow Servers must be connected to your Workflow Center to be available. To learn how to connect runtime process servers to the Workflow Center, see Customizing the Workflow Server settings used to connect to Workflow Center and Using the administrative console to customize the Workflow Server settings used to connect to Workflow Center. To run a process on a different server using the Inspector, you must first deploy the process application snapshot that contains the process that you want to run as described in Installing snapshots on a connected workflow server. Note: When you change servers or versions in the Inspector, you have to start the BPD again by choosing the run icon at the upper right of the BPD diagram. |
|             4 | Use the icons in the toolbar to manage process instances, run tasks, or debug services. For more information, see Inspector toolbar options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|             5 | Shows the current task for the selected process instance. In the preceding example, the current task is the first task in the BPD called Submit job requisition. You can click the task to select it and then use the toolbar icon to run the task so that you can step through the entire BPD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|             6 | Shows the BPD diagram for the selected instance and highlights the current task so you know where you are in the execution of the process for this instance. In the preceding example, the red token above and the yellow halo around the Submit job requisition task indicate the active step. If you want to view other information about the BPD for the selected instance, you can click the other available tabs such as Overview and Variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|             7 | Shows a navigation tree of the execution progress for the selected instance. In the preceding example, you can see the first step in the instance (the start of the process) and you can see the active second step, indicated by the red token.

## Understanding tokens

In
the Inspector interface, tokens indicate where the runtime instance
is currently executing-both in the diagram of the BPD or service and
in the navigation tree of the instance execution. The following general
rules apply to tokens:

- If a token is on a step, that step is in an active state. Until
the step has been completed, the process instance cannot proceed.
- If a token is on a conditional sequence flow, the target step
is enabled-it can receive the token-because the condition on the sequence
flow was met. Conditions are evaluated after the step has been completed
but before the process enters the outgoing sequence flow.
- A process instance can generate several tokens. For example, a
split can cause two tokens to be generated. These tokens are merged
into a single token when the process reaches a join gateway.
