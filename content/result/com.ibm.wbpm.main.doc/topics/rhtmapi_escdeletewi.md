# Additional restrictions when deleting escalation work items

Even though a user may be logged on to the client application
with a role that is authorized to delete work items, there may be
additional restrictions on which type of work item is authorized.

The following table shows the assignment reasons on an escalation
instance that a specific role may delete.
