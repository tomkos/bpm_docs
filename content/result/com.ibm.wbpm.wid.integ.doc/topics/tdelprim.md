# Deleting primitives that use XSLT and Business object maps

## About this task

## Procedure

1. In the mediation flow editor, select and right-click one
or more Mapping primitives or Business Object Map primitives
that you want to delete, then select Delete.
2 If a Mapping primitive or Business Object Mapprimitive that you want to delete references a mapping artifact, aConfirm Delete window opens to allow you to also delete the mappingartifact. Complete one of the following steps to work with the windowbox:
    - If you selected a single Mapping primitive or Business
Object Map primitive and you want to delete the directly associated
mapping artifact, select the check box and then click Yes.
(Optionally, you can first click the here link
to focus the References view and determine whether deleting the mapping
artifact will break any other artifacts that refer to it.)
    - If you selected more than one Mapping primitive
or Business Object Map primitive, either select or clear the Also
delete the <n> maps in the selected mediation primitives check
box (where <n> is the number of maps that will be deleted), then
click Yes.
