# Testing XML Maps

- Using a sample input file

A sample input file is used to ensure an XML map is performing the mapping properly. The file can be automatically generated from the New XML Mapping wizard or the XML Map editor. You can also create your own file to use for testing.
- Testing maps during iterative development

You can test XML maps during development by using one or more sample input files and the Test Map view.
- Testing XML maps in isolation

To test precompleted XML maps without editing them, you use of the Integration Test Client. The maps are not deployed to a server and do not need to be associated with a Mapping primitive.
- Debugging XML maps

XML maps are debugged in the workspace and are not deployed to a server for debugging.
