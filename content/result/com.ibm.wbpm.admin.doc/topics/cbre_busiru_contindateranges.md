# Date/Time selections

The date is defined either as part of the business rule group's operation parameter or it is
derived at run time. The dates are always in terms of UTC and are specific points in time. Only one
rule logic can be effective for an operation at any point in time. When no rule logic is found to be
in effect for any point in time, the default rule logic is used.

The business rule group supports the following date/time options, which you access by clicking
the icon in the Start Date/Time and End Date/Time
fields:
