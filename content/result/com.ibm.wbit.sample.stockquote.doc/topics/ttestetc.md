# Run the sample

After
you build or import the sample, you can test the StockQuote application in the integrated test
client or the debugger.

Lessons in this Module

- Test the mediation flow

Test your mediation flow.
- Debug the mediation flow

Debug the StockQuote\_MediationFlow component in the unit test environment by using the integration debugger.
- Change the quality of service at run time

When you built the sample, you promoted the Filter pattern property. This lets you change the value of the property at run time. Now, you will change the value of the Filter pattern property in the unit test environment's administrative console, which causes the request to be sent to a different service. You will then view the result in the test client emulator.
- Deploy to the runtime

Now that your sample is tested, you may want to deploy it to the IBM Workflow Server.
