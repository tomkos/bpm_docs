# Process Migration Specification

You have developed and deployed a business process and now need to
update it. A Process Migration Specification migrates running instances
of a previous version of the business process to an updated version
by specifying the source and the target version.

A Process Migration Specification can migrate:

- A business process that is associated with a standard IBMÂ® Integration Designer module.
- A business process that is associated to a process application
or a toolkit.

- Associated with an older version of a module to a business process
that is associated to a newer version of process application or toolkit.
- Associated with an older version of a module to a business process
associated with a newer version of a module.
- Associated with an older version of a process application or toolkit,
to a business process associated to a newer version of a process application
or toolkit.

- Creating a Process Migration Specification

Use the Process Migration Specification wizard to create a process migration specification.
- Process Migration Specification modification

When you create a process migration specification, you must use the Process Migration Specification editor to change or define its parameters.
