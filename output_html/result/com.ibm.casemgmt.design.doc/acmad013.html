<h1>Enabling and disabling plug-ins for the IBM Business Automation</h1>

<p>Workflow
desktop</p>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>Previously, IBM Content
Navigator loaded all plug-ins, even if a plug-in
was not needed for the layout or features included in a desktop. IBM Content
Navigator displays the registered plug-ins so that you can enable all
plug-ins for the desktop or select only the plug-ins that are needed.</p>

<ul>
<li>IBM Business Automation
Workflow API plug-in</li>
<li>IBM Business Automation
Workflow client plug-in</li>
<li>IBM Business Automation
Workflow custom plug-in</li>
<li>Content Platform Engine Applets Support plug-in</li>
</ul>

<p>The Case configuration tool selects the IBM Business Automation
Workflow administration plug-in to be loaded for the
IBM Business Automation
Workflow Case administration desktop. If
Box collaboration is enabled, the Case configuration tool also selects the IBM Business Automation
Workflow API plug-in and Case Box Event Listener plug-in to be loaded.</p>

<ul>
<li>IBM Business Automation
Workflow API plug-in</li>
<li>IBM Business Automation
Workflow client plug-in</li>
<li>IBM Case Dashboard plug-in</li>
</ul>

<p>You can configure the desktop to disable one or more of plug-ins or to enable other plug-ins for
use with the IBM Business Automation
Workflow desktop or IBM Business Automation
Workflow administration desktop.</p>

<p>The IBM Business Automation
Workflow Case configuration tool  does not affect the plug-ins
that are loaded for a custom desktop.</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To enable or disable a plug-in for the IBM Business Automation
Workflow
desktop:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to IBM Content
Navigator as an
administrator.
Enter the following URL in a browser:
http://server:port/navigator
server
is the IBM Content
Navigator
server name or IP address.
port is the IBM Content
Navigator port
number.</li>
<li>Navigate to Desktops &gt; IBM Business Automation
Workflow &gt; General.</li>
<li>In the Plug-ins area, select Select the deployed plug-ins to
enable for use with this desktop. Then, select the plug-ins that you want loaded for the
IBM Business Automation
Workflow desktop and clear the check box for any plug-in that
you do not want loaded.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What to do next</h2>

<p>After you enable or disable plug-ins for a desktop, ensure that the desktop works as expected.
For example, ensure that Case Client works correctly with the
Content Platform Engine Support Applets plug-in that is used to host Process
Designer and with any custom widgets packages.</p>
