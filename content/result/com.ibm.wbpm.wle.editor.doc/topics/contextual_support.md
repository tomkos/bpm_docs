# Contextual support

Contextual support ensures that when a first typed character is
Hebrew or Arabic, control orientation and typing direction are right-to-left,
and that the text alignment is right. The following is a list of the
different kinds of contextual support that Business Automation Workflow provides.

- Contextual support for names of diagram elements ensures correct
display of bidi text not only in properties but also in diagram.
- Contextual support in notes ensures right-to-left text direction
of text inside the notes.
- When a new activity is dragged from the palette and dropped onto
the business process definition (BPD) canvas, contextual typing of
the activity name is possible inside the BPD diagram.
- Contextual typing is supported in descriptions in Workflow Center.
