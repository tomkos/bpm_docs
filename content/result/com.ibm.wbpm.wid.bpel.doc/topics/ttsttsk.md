# Testing people assignment criteria

## About this task

## Procedure

1. In your human task, select the role that you want to test.
2. In the Assign People tab of the
properties page, click Test.  This
button is available for all people assignment criteria except everybody and nobody,
when all mandatory fields have a value, and requires at least one
running Workflow Server to
be defined in Servers view.
3. In the Test People Search window,
select one of the running IBMÂ® Workflow
Servers.
If the people assignment criteria contains one or more replacement
variables, the dialog box will contain an input field for each variable.
4. Enter some data that is appropriate to your human task
or the process the task is running in.
5. Click Submit. The IBM Workflow
Server will
be queried. Note that this might take some time, and, if the resulting
list is too long, only a subset will be returned. The purpose of the
test button is to check if the query works, and not to verify the
result set entirely.
