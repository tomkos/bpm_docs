# Adding extended data elements to event definitions

Extended data elements are used to express business information
and you can specify array or non-array primitive types as values.
An event definition can contain any number of extended data elements
or no extended data elements at all. By default, an event definition
inherits any extended data elements of its parent event definition.
However, using the event definition editor, you can add one or more
new extended data elements to an event definition that are independent
of the extended data elements of the parent.

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Open your event definition in the event definition editor.

Extended Data icon . A default extended data element
is added to the event definition.
