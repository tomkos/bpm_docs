# Enabling and configuring service component monitoring

- Monitoring performance

Performance measurements are available for service component event points, and are processed through the Performance Monitoring Infrastructure. You configure a server to gather performance metrics from service component event points. You can also collect Service Component Architecture-specific performance statistics directly from service invocations of applications.
- Monitoring service component events

IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow monitoring can capture the data in a service component at a certain event point. You can view each event in a log file.
