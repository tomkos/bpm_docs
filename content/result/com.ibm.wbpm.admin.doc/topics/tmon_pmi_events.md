# Specifying performance statistics to monitor

## Before you begin

## Procedure

1. Open the administrative console.
2. Select Monitoring and Tuning > Performance Monitoring Infrastructure.
3. Select the server or node agent that contains the event points that you want to monitor.

Note: You cannot choose to monitor statistics on a cluster; you can only do so on a specific server
or node.
4. Expand some of the groups, such as WBIStats.RootGroup or
Enterprise Beans.
All the statistics that can be monitored are in the listed groups. Some statistics cannot be
listed because they have not been invoked since the server was last started.
5. Select a statistic you want to monitor from the tree, and then select the statistics that you
want to collect. Then click Enable. Repeat for all statistics that you want
to monitor.
6. Go back to the server PMI configuration page by clicking the server name link.
7. Click Apply or OK.
8. Click Save.
