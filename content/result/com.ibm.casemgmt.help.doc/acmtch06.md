# Sending a link to a case in an email opens an empty tab in
the Firefox browser

## Symptoms

- Send Link to Case in the Case List widget
menu
- Send Link to Case by Email in the Case
Toolbar widget.

The Firefox dialog box opens in a new tab so that your work
in Case Client is not affected.
If you select a web email client, the login page for that email client
opens in this tab. If you select a desktop email client, the email
client opens in your desktop. However, the blank tab remains open
in the browser.
