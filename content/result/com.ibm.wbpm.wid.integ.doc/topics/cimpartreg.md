# Importing external services from registries

Let's look conceptually at how artifacts are retrieved from registries.
Using the external service wizard, you begin by connecting to a registry.
This assumes you have set up access to your registries. If you have
not set up access to your registries, you can either set up access
separately or at the same time you try to make your first connection.

Once you have connected to a registry, you issue a query to discover
your artifacts. Using editing and filtering features, you constrain
the list of artifacts to just those you want. Finally, you import
the artifacts. On importing, several helpful functions are available.
For example, you can automatically separate inline schemas in a WSDL
file into separate files.
