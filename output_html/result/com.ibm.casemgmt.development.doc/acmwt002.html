<h1>Adding an event action to a widget toolbar or menu</h1>

<p>For example, you might add an event action to the In-basket widget toolbar for a custom event
that filters work items based on a predefined property value. You might add an event action to the
Case Information widget document menu for a custom event that enables users to
select and add a case document as an attachment to the case.</p>

<ol>
<li>In Case Builder, open the page that contains the
widget in Page Designer.</li>
<li>Click the Edit Settings icon for the widget that you want to add the
event action to.</li>
<li>Click the Menus or Toolbars tab and, if necessary,
select the specific menu or toolbar to add the event action to.</li>
<li>Click the Add Menu Item icon or the Add Button
icon.</li>
<li>From the Action list, select Event Action.</li>
<li>If you are adding an event action to a toolbar, select a position from the
Alignment list.</li>
<li>For Label, enter the display name for the event action.</li>
<li>For Menu Identifier, enter an identifier that can be used by the event
handler to determine the menu or toolbar that the event action is triggered from.</li>
<li>For Event Name, enter the name of the handler for this event.</li>
<li>From the Event Type list, select how to publish the event.
Broadcast
Select Broadcast if the event is received by any event that has a
corresponding incoming event.
Wiring
Select Wiring if the event must be wired to an incoming event.</li>
<li>For Show this event action, enter a script that is
run to determine whether the button or menu item for this event action is visible. If you do not
enter a script, the button or menu item is always visible.</li>
<li>For Enable this event action, enter a script that
is run to determine whether the button or menu item for this event action is enabled. If you do not
enter a script, the button or menu item is always enabled.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
<li>Save and redeploy your solution.</li>
</ol>
