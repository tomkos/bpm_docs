# Backing up the target environment before deploying solutions

## About this task

After the backup, minimize access to the system to avoid changes
that might make the system inconsistent with the backup. You can resume
regular operations after the solution application is fully migrated
and deployed.

For details on backups, see the related topic
about backing up your IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow system.
