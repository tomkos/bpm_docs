<h1>In-baskets widget events</h1>

<p>For example, the In-baskets widget publishes an outgoing
event when the user selects a work item in an in-basket to open. The
In-baskets widget handles an incoming event to apply user-specified
filters to the list of work items.</p>

<ul>
<li>In-baskets widget outgoing events</li>
</ul>

<p>The In-baskets widget provides outgoing events that are broadcast and wired to the other widgets on the page. The data that is included in the payload of a broadcast event is processed by any widget that has a corresponding handled event. The data that is included in the payload of a wired event is processed by the handled event in the target widget to which the published widget is wired.
