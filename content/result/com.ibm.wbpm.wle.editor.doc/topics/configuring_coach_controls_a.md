# Populating a list with static data in a heritage coach (deprecated)

## About this task

Typically, a heritage coach displays business data that resides in a variable, enabling IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow users to view and interact with the data. In
the initial design stages, you may need to populate a heritage coach with static (manual) data so
that you can illustrate the type of data that the process will display at run time.

The following example illustrates a combo
box control that uses static data to populate a list of options.

## Procedure

1. Open the service that contains the heritage coach that you want to work with and then click the
Coaches tab.
2. Drag a combo box control from the palette onto the design
area.
3. Click the Presentation option in the properties.
4. Under Manual Data, click the Add button
to create a row for each option that you want to add to the list.
The value that you type in the Display Text column is the name of
the option that is displayed to the user at run time.
5. Click the Preview tab to see how
the list will work when the service runs.
