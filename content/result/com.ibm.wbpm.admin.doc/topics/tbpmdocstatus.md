# Obtaining the status of the BPM document store

## Before you begin

- The command must be run on the deployment manager node.
- One or more application cluster members must be running.
- The command must be run in connected mode. Do not specify the wsadmin
-conntype none option.
- You must connect to the deployment manager with a user ID that
has WebSphere Application Server operator privileges.

Start the wsadmin scripting client from the
profile\_root/bin directory of the deployment manager
profile. The getDocumentStoreStatus command does not write to a log file, but the
wsadmin scripting client always writes a
profile\_root/logs/wsadmin.traceout log file where you will
find exception stack traces and other information.

Before
you attempt to obtain the status of the BPM document store, review Limitations in administering the BPM document store.
