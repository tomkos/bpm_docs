# Backing up data

When you are thinking about disaster recovery, focus on this question: What
is the best way to build a disaster recovery solution for the organizationâ€™s
business process applications? Base your infrastructure design
decisions on the real needs of your business. Before you start to
consider how you want to configure a disaster recovery system, make
sure that you clearly define your priorities.

This system is simple to set
up if you are just backing up a single server. If you are backing
up a distributed production environment, you must set up a shared
file system, such as  the network file system (NFS) on UNIX.

Each backup method has its own constraints, advantages, and disadvantages,
as described in the accompanying table.

| Managed by the operating system         | This type of replication ensures a coherent state across all data that is being replicated. For runtime data, this requirement means that no work can occur throughout the entire production environment during the replication. Business Process Manager servers must be quiesced and stopped. | This system is  inexpensive and simple to maintain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | This approach requires a maintenance window, which imposes limits on the server availability and on the recovery point objective. Therefore, it might not be appropriate for business-critical production servers.  To minimize your recovery point objective, determine the ideal backup frequency by considering the business requirements and resources to take and maintain your backups. |
| Managed by a storage area network (SAN) | The production system can write to only one file system. The SAN must provide the capability to define a single consistency group that contains all replicated volumes, including those volumes that host the database and the shared file system for the transaction and compensation logs.    | This replication type is the classic technique for disaster recovery. SAN replication capability is robust and well documented. Depending on the sophistication of the SAN being used, replication points can be very short.  This method can be used to manage consistent replication across various managed resources. Most SAN systems support both periodic snapshots and synchronous replication of data to a remote site. | Requires extra hardware (the SAN), which is not available for all environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Managed by the database                 | The database manager must have access to all the data that must be replicated. To use this method, WebSphere Application Server transaction and compensation logs must be stored within the database.                                                                                           | Database replication solutions like DB2 HADR and Oracle Data Guard are familiar to many infrastructure teams. Various synchronous and asynchronous qualities of service are possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Configuring all managed resources in to the same database can be problematic, depending on the amount of integration present in the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
