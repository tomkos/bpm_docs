# Setting assembly editor preferences

You can use the Preferences window to modify the assembly
editor settings for its layout and wiring prompts.

## Procedure

To modify the assembly editor preferences settings, complete
the following steps:

1. From the menu, click Window > Preferences to open the Preferences window.
2. Expand Business Integration and
click Assembly Editor to see the settings that
you can modify. For more information on one of the settings, press
the Tab key to focus on the setting and press F1. Tip: If you do not see Assembly Editor,
then expand Workbench to select Capabilities,
check Integration Designer and
click Apply to enable the business integration
tools. Click OK to close the Preferences page.
Go back to the first step to open Preferences again, and, this time,
you should see Business Integration.
3. Modify the settings and click Apply.
4. Expand Assembly Editor.  You
can use the two preferences under Assembly Editor to
simplify the process of introducing Javaâ„¢ components,
EJB imports, and stand-alone references into a WSDL environment. These
tools generate or convert the interfaces and partner references so
that the Java component can be more easily
connected to WSDL components.
5. Click one of the entries to see or modify the settings
for that utility. For more information on one of the settings on those
pages, press the Tab key to focus on a setting and then press F1.
6. Click Apply to save your changes.
7. Click OK to close the Preferences window.
