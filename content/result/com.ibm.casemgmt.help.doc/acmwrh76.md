# Viewer widget

The Viewer widget uses the viewer that is configured
for IBMÂ® Content
Navigator to display
documents. The IBM Content
Navigator viewer
allows users to view and annotate image documents.

You cannot configure the Viewer widget from IBM Business Automation
Workflow. Instead, you use the IBM Content
Navigator administration tool to configure a viewer map for the
   Viewer widget.

## IBM Business Automation
Workflow pages that include this
widget by default

The
Viewer widget is included on the Work Details page.

- Wiring Viewer widgets to display documents from different widgets

If you open documents from different widgets on a page, the Viewer widget by default opens each document in a separate tab. To better distinguish the documents that are opened from different widgets, you can place multiple Viewer widgets on the page. You then wire the widgets to display documents in specific Viewer widgets.
- Viewer widget events

The Viewer widget handles incoming events to display case documents and work item attachments to users.
