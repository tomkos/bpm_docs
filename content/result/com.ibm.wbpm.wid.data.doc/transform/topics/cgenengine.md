# Generating business object or XSLT maps

- XSLT version 1.0
- XSLT version 2.0
- business object map

When you target a business object map to be created, the business
object map is generated at build time  in the IBM Integration Designer
toolkit. The business object map is located in the Module|Library|gen
folder and registered in serviceDeploy.

Also,  when the XML map editor is set to generate a business object
map, the map editor only displays transformations that are valid in
the business object map  domain. This is a subset of what is supported
when the XML  map editor is set to generate XSLT 1.0 or XSLT 2.0.

- Setting the map generation type

To specify which type of transformation file to generate, use the map editor Properties view.
