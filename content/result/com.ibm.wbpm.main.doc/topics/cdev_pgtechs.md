For details of the application programming interfaces (APIs) and system programming interfaces
(SPIs), see IBM Business Automation Workflow API reference.

Several sets of REST APIs are provided for programming components, applications, and services.
- Syntax for text with embedded JavaScript

In certain situations, you can combine literal text with parts that are computed dynamically.
- JavaScript API programming guide

In the designer, all variables are JavaScript variables so you can use JavaScript code snippets inside your components to improve the behavior of your model. A number of JavaScript libraries are provided. You can also import or create your own libraries.
- Business Automation Workflow web service APIs programming guide (deprecated)

The application programming interface (API) for web service clients defines a number of schemas and provides a set of operations to access Process Designer functionality from an external client application.
- Programming BPEL processes and tasks

You can use a modeling tool to build and deploy BPEL processes and tasks in Business Automation Workflow. These processes and tasks are interacted with at run time, for example, a process is started, or tasks are claimed and completed. You can use Business Process Choreographer Explorer to interact with processes and tasks, or the Business Process Choreographer APIs to develop customized clients for these interactions.
- Enterprise Service Bus programming

This development guide is for enterprise architects, integration architects and developers who are responsible for implementing integration and connectivity solutions. It begins with the high-level concepts and abilities that will help you to understand the capabilities and usage patterns of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). The development guide then describes how to implement the capabilities and patterns on IBM Workflow Server.
- Service Component Architecture programming

Service Component Architecture (SCA) provides a simple, yet powerful programming model for constructing applications based on service-oriented architecture (SOA).
- Business objects programming

Business objects are containers for application data, such as a customer or an invoice. Data is exchanged between components by way of business objects.
- Business rule management programming
