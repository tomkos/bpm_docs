# Categorizing views

In previous versions, the view palette displayed all the available views, grouped by tag. The
view palette benefits now from a streamlined design that enables you to  group views into functional
categories, filter them by name, description, tag, and category, and display them one category at a
time.

- To include a view in a category, assign the corresponding category tag to the view. When you
assign the Workflow tag to a view, for example, the view will show up in the Workflow category in
the palette.
- You should not assign more than one category tag to a view. Views that have no category tags
assigned are displayed in the Uncategorized category.
- You can also use tags other than the category ones, which you can search and display in the
palette.
- Variables also have their own predefined category in the palette header.

To hide views from the palette for all users, you can use the Hidden tag. This tag can be
reserved for less usual circumstances, such as hiding the default task completion view. To make a
hidden view visible again, you can change its tag either by using the Tags
context menu in the library, or from the Overview page of the view.
