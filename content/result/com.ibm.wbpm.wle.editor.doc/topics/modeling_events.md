# Modeling events

- Event types

Learn about the types of events available in processes and when to use each type.
- Modeling delays, escalations, and timeouts by using timer events

To specify when an activity occurs or when another path in the process should be taken, use intermediate and boundary events of the timer type.
- Modeling message events

Use a message event to represent a point in your process where an incoming message is received or where an outgoing message is sent.
- Modeling event gateways

Use an event gateway to model a point in the process execution where only one of several paths can be followed, depending on events that occur.
- Handling errors using error events

When you design a process or a service, provide logic to recover from possible errors that might be generated in the runtime application.
- Using Service Component Architecture to interact with processes

There are several ways to start and interact with process instances using Service Component Architecture (SCA). You can use receiving message events to create or interact with process instances.
