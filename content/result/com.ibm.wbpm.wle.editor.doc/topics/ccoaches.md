# Coaches

You can use coaches to build different types of user interfaces, such as task completion,
dashboard, startable service, general purpose (URL-addressable), and process instance UI.

When a coach is a task completion user interface page, it is part of the human service flow. When
the flow enters the coach, the user sees the user interface that is defined for that coach. The flow
leaves the coach when a boundary event occurs. A coach can have multiple exit flows with each one
associated with a different boundary event. At run time, the human task results in a work item in
Workplace or Process Portal, which the user
navigates to see the user interface.

A dashboard is a stand-alone user interface that users can run at any time. Users can access
dashboards through Workplace or Process Portal. For information
about dashboards, see Managing work for teams and Dashboards in Process Portal.

A startable service can be started in Workplace or Process Portal at any time. For
a general purpose UI, a URL service creates a stand-alone UI that can be called directly through a
URL. A process instance UI can be an instance details UI or a process launch UI.
