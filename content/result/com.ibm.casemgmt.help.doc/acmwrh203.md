# Preparing to use the Content List widget

## About this task

If
you want to substitute search criteria with event data at run time,
you must set the stored search criteria as editable conditions. If
you do not wire the Content List widget to substitute stored search
criteria, the widget retrieves documents based on the predefined search
criteria.
