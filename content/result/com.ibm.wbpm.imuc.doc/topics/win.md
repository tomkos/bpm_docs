# Installing and configuring IBM Business Automation
Workflow on
Windows

Install IBM Business Automation
Workflow on Windows and
configure a network deployment environment. For IBM Business Automation Workflow
Enterprise, you can configure a single-cluster or a
three-cluster deployment environment. IBM Business Automation Workflow
Express
is always a single-cluster environment.

IBM Business Automation
Workflow Enterprise Service Bus can be installed
in a single-cluster or a three-cluster deployment environment, which must be an AdvancedOnly
environment. It does not have a typical installation option. You must use custom installation to
install and then use BPMConfig to create an AdvancedOnly deployment environment.
