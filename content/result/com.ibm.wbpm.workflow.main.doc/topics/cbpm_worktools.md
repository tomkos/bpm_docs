## Workplace

Workplace
is the newer, highly customizable work portal where you can manage, prioritize, track, and complete
both process and case work in one place. Workplace is built on
newer technologies and is provided as a modern and more inclusive alternative to the process-centric
Process Portal.

Workplace
is available in both on-premises and container Business Automation Workflow environments, which
makes it the common work portal for different platforms. You can run Workplace on-premises
in either single Business Automation Workflow systems or federated
environments.

- An improved user experience working on tasks and completing both process and case work in a
dynamic and modern client-side human service-based user interface.
- Customizable and reusable views enable you to organize and shape your own custom-built portal to
work with tasks and complete work efficiently.
- Advanced searches to refine your process and case lists are available in Workplace in either federated or
nonfederated environments through indexing into Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.
- Managers can manage the work of their teams and use dashboards to evaluate their workload and
act on their performance.

## Process Portal

Process Portal is the
earlier coach-based user interface provided with all editions of Business Automation Workflow for participating in
processes. It can be configured for a single Business Automation Workflow system or federated
environments that include IBMÂ® Process Federation
Server. From Process Portal, users can launch
processes, dashboards, and startable services, and work on their tasks.

In IBM BPM V8.5.7, Process Portal replaced  Heritage Process Portal that was available
from IBM BPM V7.5
onwards.

See Heritage Process Portal (deprecated).

Process Portal provides
access to all heritage capabilities and introduces many new features, such as saved searches. The
new responsive user interface provides you with more flexibility to get work done anywhere, at any
time, on any device type, from a desktop device in the office to a mobile device at home or at a
customer site.

Because Process Portal is
based on coaches, it is customizable. For example, the coaches use the Classic
theme, which means that you can easily change the overall styling to fit your organization's look
and feel. In addition, a set of configuration options are available for you to adapt Process Portal behavior without
having to customize the Process Portal application itself.

To search business data, Process Portal provides a robust
search capability. You can also create customized views of your tasks, for example, with specific
business data, by saving your task-based searches for later use. You can also share your saved
search with the members of your team.

You can use the Process Portal dashboards to analyze
and manage the work on your business processes. You can use the ready-to-use dashboards that
Process Portal includes or
company-specific dashboards that your installation might provide.

If Process Portal is
configured for a federated environment, you can access processes and tasks on any IBM BPM system in the federated
environment running V8.0.1.3 or later, or on a Business Automation Workflow system, from a single
Process Portal sign-on.
