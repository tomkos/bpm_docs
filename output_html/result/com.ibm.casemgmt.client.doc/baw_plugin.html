<h1>Working with processes</h1>

<p>Traditional:  The
IBM® Business Automation
Workflow plug-in for IBM Content
Navigator provides a
unified content workflow by bringing your Workplace task list into the IBM Business Automation
Workflow desktop.</p>

<p>You can then view your tasks in the desktop, claim them, and work on them just as you do in
Workplace. You can also start
a workflow process from a document in the IBM Business Automation
Workflow desktop.</p>

<h2>Before you begin</h2>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>If the Browse view is enabled for
the IBM Business Automation
Workflow desktop, the
Launch Process menu item is available to start processes from documents shown
in the Browse view. For more information, see Enabling the Browse view in the IBM Business Automation Workflow desktop.</p>

<p>If the document view
is enabled for the Case Information widget, the Launch Process menu item
might be available in Case Client
to start processes from documents shown in the Document view. This option requires that the
Launch Process item be added to the menu in Case Builder. For more information, see
Documents view for the Case Information widget.</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To view the Workplace task list:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Features drop-down list in the IBM Business Automation
Workflow desktop, click the
Workplace icon .
The current task list for the logged in user is shown in Workplace. You can view a task, claim
it, and work on it.</li>
<li>Right-click the appropriate document and select the menu item that is used to start a
process. For example, if you are working in the Browse view, select Workflow &gt; Launch Process. The Launch Process dialog opens and displays a list of the
processes that can be started from the document.</li>
<li>Select the name of the process that you want to start and click
OK.
The Successfully started the process message is displayed in the
status bar of the IBM Business Automation
Workflow
desktop.
If the process is configured with a launch step, Workplace automatically opens and the
launch step is displayed. Similarly, if the first task in the process is assigned to you, Workplace automatically opens and the
task is displayed.</li>

automatically open, click the Workplace icon .</li>
