<h1>Cannot view values when you edit cells in table-based rules</h1>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>When
you click in a cell of a table-based business rule, you cannot see
the values as you type or edit them until you press Enter.</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<h2>Resolving the problem</h2>

<p>To
work around this problem, try to expand the cell so that you can view
the entire typing area. Alternatively, you can edit the value by right-clicking
a cell and clicking Edit Custom Value.</p>
