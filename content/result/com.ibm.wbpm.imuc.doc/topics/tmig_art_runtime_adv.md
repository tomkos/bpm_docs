# Migrating server runtime targets

When you import a project interchange file that contains modules from a previous version
of IBM Integration
Designer or
WebSphere Integration Developer, a migration wizard is automatically launched in IBM Integration
Designer 24.x. If the project
interchange file contains any projects that target a previous version of the server runtime, the
migration wizard contains a wizard page that enables you to automatically update the projects to
target the current server runtime of Integration Designer.
