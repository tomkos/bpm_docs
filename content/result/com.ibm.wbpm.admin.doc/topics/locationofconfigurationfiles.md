IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow on containers
supports one 100Custom.xml file, which includes all the needed customization.
It is mounted as /opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/config/199Custom.xml in
the Workflow server pod. The current settings for a running server are in
/opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/TeamWorksConfiguration.running.xml.

- At run time, only the settings from the cluster member files are read.
- For ND environments, XML configuration files on the cluster level serve as templates for the XML
configuration files that are created when new cluster members are added. Also, XML configuration
files on the cluster level are used by certain administrative commands that run in local mode, such
as the BPMUpdateSystemApp command.
- For the Workflow Center deployment environment, the server\_type value is
either performance-data-warehouse, or process-center. For the
Workflow Server deployment environment, the server\_type value is either
performance-data-warehouse, or process-server.
- Both standalone and single-cluster environments can have two directories for each server.
- For three-cluster environments, the process-center or
process-server files are for the application cluster. The
performance-data-warehouse files are for the support cluster.

## System configuration files

The default runtime properties are defined in the system configuration files. These system
configuration files may be updated by software updates, and should not be manually changed. The
system configuration files are found in the following locations:
