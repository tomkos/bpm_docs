# Creating a new rule from a template in the rule set editor

## About this task

Business rules based on templates are dynamically modifiable
in the runtime environment. The parameters of the rule can be modified
within certain constraints. Base your rule on a template if you want
to give your business analyst the ability to modify the parameters
of a rule without involving the integration developer.

## Procedure

1. In the rule set editor, click the Add Template
rule icon (). A drop down
list appears showing all available templates.
2. From the list, click the appropriate template.
A new rule appears.
3. In the Presentation row, define the parameters by clicking Enter
Value. If there is an enumeration constraint
in effect, a menu will appear showing your available options. Otherwise,
you may enter a value directly.
