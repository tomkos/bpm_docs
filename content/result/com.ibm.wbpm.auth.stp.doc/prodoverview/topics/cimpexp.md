# Imports and exports

- Service import and export binding types

Binding information specifies the means of transporting data from modules. An import binding describes the way that an external service is bound to an import component. An export binding describes the way that the services of a module are made available to clients.
- Selecting appropriate bindings

When you are creating an application, you need to know how to select the binding that is most appropriate to the needs of your application.
