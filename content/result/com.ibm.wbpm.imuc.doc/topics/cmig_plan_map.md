# Mapping your source environment to Business Automation Workflow 24.0.0.0

If you are planning to migrate your business data and applications
to IBM® Business Automation Workflow 24.0.0.0, the
topology of your target environment depends on your current source
environment.

The following table provides the most common mapping examples for
the product, version, and release level combinations that are supported
as sources for migrating to IBM Business Automation Workflow 24.0.0.0. Other
possible mappings include mapping a single-cluster topology to a 3-cluster
topology, and mapping a multiple-cluster topology to a single-cluster
topology. The latter is likely not an appropriate choice for production
environments.
