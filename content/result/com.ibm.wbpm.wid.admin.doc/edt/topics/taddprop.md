# Adding properties to event definitions

Properties are used to store system information and correlation
data as string values. An event definition can contain any number
of properties or no properties at all. By default, an event definition
inherits any properties of its parent event definition. However, using
the event definition editor, you can add one or more new properties
to an event definition that are independent of the properties of the
parent.
