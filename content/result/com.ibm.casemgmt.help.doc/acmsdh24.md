# Assigning properties to a step

## About this task

## Procedure

To assign a property to a step:

1. In the Step Designer, click the step.
2. In the Step Properties section, specify the name of the
step, a description, and any instructions for the case worker.
3. Optional: 
Add a response from the menu. 
You can add responses by clicking the Edit icon
(...).
4. Select whether the task can be reassigned to another case
worker from the menu.
5. You can specify the deadline and when the reminder is sent
in minutes, hours, days, or weeks.
6. Set the read and write option for each case property, workgroup,
or attachment.
The Read and Write option
is selected by default, and the case worker can edit the property
value. Select Read only to prevent the case
worker from changing the property value.
7. Select the page layout, a swimlane, and split and join
operators.
If you need to move a step from one swimlane
to another, change the swimlane property.
8. Click Save.
To save the
changes that you made to the step properties, ensure that you click Save.
Any unsaved changes will be lost when Step Designer is closed.
