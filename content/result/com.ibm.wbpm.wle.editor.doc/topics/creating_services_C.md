# Exposing heritage human services (deprecated)

## Before you begin

## Procedure

1. Open a process app or toolkit in Process Designer
2. Open the heritage human service that you want to expose and switch to
Overview.
3. Select the team that you whose members can view and use
the exposed service.  In the Process Designer, set the Exposed to
start option under Usage. In the desktop Process Designer, set the Exposed to
option under the Exposing section.
4 Specify how you want to use the service. In the Use As or ExposeAs list, select one of the following options. Table 1. Exposing options Option Description Task (Service containedin a process) or Do Not Expose (Service contained in a BPD orcase type) Use this default option for services that implementthe activities within a process. When this option is selected, the Exposedto setting is not used. Administration Service (Available in the ProcessAdmin Console) Use this option to make the heritage human serviceavailable to members of the selected team as a separate page in theProcess Admin Console in the Server Admin capabilities. A new categoryis added to the menu, which has the same name as the process applicationthat contains the service. The name of the individual page in thenew category matches the service name. Startable Service (Launch from Process Portal ) Use this option to enable members of the selectedteam to start the service from the Launch list in Process Portal . Dashboard (Available in Process Portal Dashboardsmenu) Use this option to make the heritage humanservice available in Process Portal tomembers of the selected team. Team members can access the dashboardby clicking the Organize tabs icon , and selecting the dashboard from the list of hiddenpages. If you do not specify a localization resource for the dashboardname, the dashboard page has the same name as the exposed service. Ifyou defined a localization resource for your dashboard name, click Select nextto the Label field and select the key in theresource. See Globalizing dashboard names . Ifthe heritage human service is in a toolkit, you must complete thefollowing steps: If you want to expose the dashboard outside of Process Portal , generatea portlet that you can deploy to a portal server by clicking Createa Portlet from the Dashboard . URL (Available from a URL only) Use this option to make the service availablefrom a URL address. For information about the REST API that providesthe URL for the exposed service, see REST Interface for BPD-related Resources - Exposed ItemsResource .

| A portlet in an external portal server | You can export only one valid snapshot when you generate a portlet for a dashboard.

- Enabling resumable services

To enable resumable dashboards for a process application, you must configure the com.ibm.bpm.social.zResumable property.
- Globalizing dashboard names

If you want dashboard names in Process Portal to be available in multiple languages, define a localization resource for each dashboard name.
- Generating portlets for heritage human services exposed as dashboards (deprecated)

If you exposed a heritage human service as a dashboard for a group of process participants, and you want to use the dashboard in IBM WebSphere® Portal, generate a portlet. Then the portal server administrator can deploy the JSR 286 portlet to the portal server runtime environment.
