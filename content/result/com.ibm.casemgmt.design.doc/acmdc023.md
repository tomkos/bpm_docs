# Deploying a solution with Business Automation Workflow

You use different ways to deploy a solution depending on the type of
server to which you are deploying the solution.

- If you are using a Workflow Center
development profile environment, deploy promoted case solution projects by using Workflow Center.
You can deploy legacy case solutions by using legacy Case Builder or Case administration client.
- If you are using a Workflow Server production profile
environment, you can install a solution by using Workflow Center or the command line for offline installation. You can deploy legacy case
solutions by using Case administration client.
