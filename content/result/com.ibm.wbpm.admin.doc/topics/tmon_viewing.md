# Viewing monitored events

- Viewing performance metrics with the Tivoli Performance Viewer

You can use the TivoliÂ® Performance Viewer to start and stop performance monitoring; view Performance Monitoring Infrastructure data in chart or table form as it occurs on your system; and, optionally, log the data to a file that you can later review in the same viewer.
- Viewing and interpreting service component event log files

This topic discusses how you would interpret the information in a log file generated by service component monitoring. You can view the log files in the log viewer on the administrative console, or in a separate text file editor of your choice.
