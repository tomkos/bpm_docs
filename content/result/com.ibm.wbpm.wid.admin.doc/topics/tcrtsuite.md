# Creating component test suites

## About this task

The following topics provide detailed information on creating
component test suites.

- Creating test suites without test cases

When you create a test suite, you can choose to initially create it without any test cases. This enables you to defer the process of defining test cases for the test suite until a later time.
- Creating test suites with operation-level test cases

When you create a test suite and select operation-level testing, a test case is automatically generated for each operation that you select for testing and the test case makes a single invocation on the component.
- Creating test suites with scenario-based test cases

When you create a test suite and select scenario-based testing, a single test case is automatically generated for all of the operations that you select for testing. The test case makes a series of invocations on one or more components that make up the scenario. You can choose the order in which you want the operations to be tested and the operations will be tested in sequence.
