## About this task

## Procedure

To add an external property to a container in Properties View Designer:

1. In the Properties palette, select Run time only
from the drop-down list. Then, drag External Property into the
container.
2 Select the external property and edit the settings:
    1. Enter the collection identifier and property identifier that Case Client will use to locate the property at run time.
    2. Select the data type of the external property and define the property settings as needed.

You can leave the data type as Unspecified. In this situation, Case Client determines the data type at run time and uses the appropriate
default control for editing the property.
