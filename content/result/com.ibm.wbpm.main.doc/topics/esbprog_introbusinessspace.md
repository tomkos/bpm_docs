# Introduction to Business Space

Business Space includes the concept of spaces, templates, pages and widgets. A space is a
collection of pages based on a template, and a page is a canvas that contains a number of widgets.
Widgets are the pluggable user interface components that you use to define the functionality of your
business spaces. IBM Business Automation
Workflow
 ships a number of built-in templates and
widgets.

Business Space provides administrative capabilities to control and manage the applications
installed on the system using these capabilities.
