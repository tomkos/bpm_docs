# Business Automation Workflow security
roles

- Use the product launchpad for a typical installation. This method automatically creates the
authentication aliases for the CellAdmin, DeAdmin, DbUser, and DbUserXAR roles. You enter one user
ID and password for both the DbUser role and the DbUserXAR role.
- Use the BPMConfig command. This method requires that you specify theauthentication aliases for the CellAdmin, DeAdmin, DbUser, DbUserXAR, and ProcessCenterUser roles.
    - The ProcessCenterUser role is used for online workflow servers.
    - You specify the authentication alias for the CellAdmin role only if the
BPMConfig command is also being used to create the profile. If you use the
BPMConfig command on existing profiles, the CellAdmin role's authentication alias
is already configured.
    - When you use this method, you can specify any of the other roles as needed for your
environment.
- Use the administrative console's Deployment Environment wizard. This method requires that youspecify the authentication aliases for the DeAdmin, DbUser, DbUserXAR, and ProcessCenterUser roles.

- The ProcessCenterUser role is used for online workflow servers.
- You enter one user ID and password for both the DbUser role and the DbUserXAR role.
- When you use this method, you cannot specify any other roles as needed for your
environment.
- Use the manageprofiles command-line utility.

- You can specify the CellAdmin role's authentication alias only in the
manageprofiles
-adminAliasName parameter.
- The deployment environment is created after profile creation, so there are no deployment
environment-level authentication aliases to configure during profile creation.
- Using the Profile Management Tool.

- The Profile Management Tool automatically associates the CellAdmin role to the CellAdminAlias
authentication alias. It does not allow you to specify a different authentication alias.

- Each authentication alias only contains only one user ID and password.
- Each authentication alias can be mapped to one or more roles.
- Each scenario may require more than one role to complete the scenario.
- The following roles require additional stepswhen you update the role to an authentication alias mapping:
    - BPMAuthor - The BPMAuthor user must be a member of either
the tw\_admins or tw\_authors groups.
    - CellAdmin - Add the user to the administrator role in
WebSphereÂ® Application
Server and to the groups defined as the admin and
author groups in Business Automation Workflow. The groups are either the
tw\_admins and tw\_authors defaults, or the groups defined by the bpmAdminGroup properties and
bpmAuthorGroup if the groups have been modified. For more information about the administrator role
in WebSphere Application
Server, see Security planning overview. If the password is changed, ensure that you
follow all of the steps listed in the topic Changing IBM Business Automation Workflow passwords.
    - DEAdmin - Add the user to
the administrator, deployer and operator roles in WebSphere Application
Server and to
the groups defined as the admin and author groups in Business Automation Workflow. The
groups are either the tw\_admins and tw\_authors defaults, or the groups
defined by the bpmAdminGroup properties and bpmAuthorGroup if the
groups have been modified.
    - SCADeploymentUser - Add the
user to the deployer and operator roles in WebSphere Application
Server.
    - EmbeddedECMTechnicalUser - The technical user musthave the WebSphere ApplicationServer administrator role. There must be an authorized user assigned to this role at every point in theruntime process. Authorization in the BPM document store refers to unique userIDs, so a user with the same name is not considered the same user. This is important if you intendto delete and recreate a user, or switch to a different user registry. A user assigned to thisrole is configured with the following permissions for an embedded environment: For an external Content Platform Engine configuration, ensure the user assigned to theEmbeddedECMTechnicalUser role is configured as For an external Content Navigator configuration, ensure the user assigned to theEmbeddedECMTechnicalUser role is configured as See Administering the technical user for the BPM document store .

A user assigned to this
role is configured with the following permissions for an embedded environment:

        - Domain administrator for the embedded document store
        - Object store administrator for the target object store
        - Administrator for the embedded Content Navigator

For an external Content Platform Engine configuration, ensure the user assigned to the
EmbeddedECMTechnicalUser role is configured as

        - Domain administrator or GCD administrator
        - Object store administrator for the target object store

For an external Content Navigator configuration, ensure the user assigned to the
EmbeddedECMTechnicalUser role is configured as

        - Administrator for Content Navigator

1. Log in to the administrative console.
