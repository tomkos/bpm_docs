# Example: applying the Carbon theme

The Carbon theme is available in the System Data toolkit and provides visual assets, such as
colors, icons, and typefaces that align the look and feel of your process applications and views
with the guidelines of the IBM Design System. For more information, see Carbon Design
System.

By default, any new process application uses the Carbon theme, which
contains all the definitions that are used by the views in the UI toolkit. This example shows how to
apply the Carbon theme to an existing process application that uses the Classic
theme, and illustrates how changing the theme changes the look of the Hiring Sample.

1. Open the Hiring Sample in Process Designer.
2. Open the process app settings for the Hiring Sample. Under Coach Designer
Settings, change the Classic theme to the Carbon theme.
3. Click Save or Finish Editing. The save triggers generating
the CSS that Process Designer uses to display the
views in the layout.
4. To see the effect of changing the theme, open the Create Position Request client-side human
service, and then open the Create position request coach. The following image shows the look of the
Create position request coach when the Carbon theme is applied:
