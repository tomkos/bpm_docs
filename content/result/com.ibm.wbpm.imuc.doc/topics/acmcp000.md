# Extending your case management system

- Integrating IBM case analytics tools

Case analytics tools can help you monitor and manage your daily business operations. The tools can also provide historical trend information that enables you to adjust future operations as needed. This information can help you discover new business patterns and trends, and to identify new business opportunities.
- Integrating with the IBM Case Monitor dashboard

You can use the IBM Case Monitor dashboard to view of business activity data that is specific to case management systems. This dashboard, which is an IBM® Content Navigator desktop, provides a dashboard that displays widgets that show case and activity happenings across solutions. You can use this data to review volume, find and eliminate bottlenecks, and ensure that operations are working efficiently and effectively.
- Integrating IBM Watson Explorer Analytical Components

IBM Watson Explorer Analytical Components provides unstructured analytics based on textual pattern discovery. The IBM Watson Explorer Analytical Components integration with IBM FileNet® P8 is extended to include a crawler that is specific to case management solutions.

You can integrate Operational Decision Manager with IBM Business Automation Workflow to manage your IBM Business Automation Workflow rules and rules from other parts of your business in a single application. If you plan to use this integration, you must first install the Operational Decision Manager licensed program on a server in your IBM Business Automation Workflow environment.
- Integrating with a version control system (VCS)

You can integrate IBM Business Automation Workflow with a version control system (VCS) such as IBM Rational Team Concert or PTC Integrity. You can then keep a record in the VCS of the changes made to a solution over time.
