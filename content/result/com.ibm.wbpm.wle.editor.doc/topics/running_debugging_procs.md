# Running and debugging processes in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

You can use the Inspector to demonstrate current process design
and implementation in playback sessions. Playback sessions help capture
important information from different stakeholders in a process, such
as management, end users, and business analysts. Taking an iterative
approach to process development ensures that your process applications
meet the goals and needs of everyone involved.

The Inspector in Process Designer includes
several tools that enable you to complete tasks like the following
in each of your configured environments:

| Task                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manage instances of processes    | When you run a process, you can view all previously run and currently running instances on the IBM Business Automation Workflow servers in your environment. You can manage running instances by halting and then resuming them, for example. You can also manage previously run instances by filtering or deleting specific records.                                                                                       |
| Step through and debug a process | For a selected instance, see the currently running step and then move forward through the process, evaluating process execution step by step. A tree display of the process combined with indicators called tokens in the process diagram make it easy to understand where you are in the process. You also have the advantage of seeing the variables used in each step and their corresponding values (where applicable). |

See the following topics to learn more about using the Inspector
interface.

- Managing process instances in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Manage current and previously running instances of your process on the server that you select.
- Stepping through a process in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Step through process execution to ensure that your BPD works as expected.
- Debugging a process in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Use the Inspector debugging feature to examine each underlying process or service in each step of your process execution to perform a more thorough inspection than stepping through your process.
- Resolving errors when running a BPD (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Find the source of errors generated when running your business process definition (BPD) and resolve them.
- Desktop Process Designer Inspector reference (deprecated)
