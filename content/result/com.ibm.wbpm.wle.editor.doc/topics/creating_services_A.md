| Component icon              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Selection tool              | Use to select and move components on the diagram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Sequence Flow tool          | Use to connect service components to establish the order in which the steps in the service occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Server Script               | Use when you want to write JavaScript to run on the Workflow Server in the service context. The Server Script component is useful for parsing through variables and executing programmatic commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Server Scriptlet            | Use to bind blocks of formatted text (for example, HTML, XML, or XSLT) directly to a service variable. This eliminates the need to store large blocks of text in default values for variables. For more information, see Using scriptlets in script tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Decision Gateway            | Use to model a point in the process execution where only one of several paths can be followed, depending on a condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| End Event                   | Use to end service execution. For services that contain multiple paths, each path requires its own end event. Note: An end event is automatically included each time you create a service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Note                        | Use to add information about the overall service or each step in the service to the diagram. Adding notes helps other developers understand your design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Error End Event             | Use to purposely throw an error and end processing. You might, for example, use an Error End Event component if you return too many rows from a database (over a limit that is normal and would bog down the server).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Invoke UCA                  | Use to invoke an undercover agent (UCA) from your service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Error Intermediate Event    | Use to listen for errors from the service component to which it is attached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Intermediate Tracking Event | Use to indicate a point in a service at which you want IBM Business Automation Workflow to capture the runtime data for reporting purposes. For more information about tracking data, see Enabling processes for tracking and reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Modify Task                 | Use to change the priority, due date, status, or other aspects of a task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Nested Service              | Use to incorporate other services in your current service. Nested services are generally defined to perform specific, repeatable functions such as exception handling routines, integration with outside systems, or data manipulation. Nested services are often used in multiple process applications and likely reside in a toolkit. Note: Heritage human services (deprecated) can be nested only within other heritage human services. Ajax services cannot be nested. Note: You must use a nested service to invoke an Advanced Integration service. |
| Send Alert                  | Use to send task-related alerts (deprecated). In prior releases, the Send Alert component was used to send alerts to an IBM Process Portal user. Starting in IBM Business Automation Workflow V8, alerts can be retrieved only with the TWSearch JavaScript API by querying on tasks with the status of Alert.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
