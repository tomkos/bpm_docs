# Deactivating snapshots on a Workflow Center server

## About this task

If you activated a snapshot that contains a process, you were
able to run the process on IBMÂ® Process
Portal. When you deactivate the snapshot, the process is no longer available
to be run on Process Portal.

On Workflow Center, the
user can activate and deactivate snapshots if they are a repository admin, a project admin, or has
project write permissions. On Workflow Server, the user can activate
and deactivate snapshots if the user is a system admin.

## Procedure

To deactivate a snapshot in the classic Workflow Center, complete the following steps:

1. Select the Process Apps or Toolkits tab.
2. Click to select the process application or toolkit for
which you want to deactivate a snapshot. If multiple tracks
exist, select the track that you want from the drop-down menu.
3. Find the snapshot that you want, and then click Deactivate from its pop-up menu  ().
