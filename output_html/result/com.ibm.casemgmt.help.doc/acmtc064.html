<h1>Unicode names are incorrect in case package for documents with non-English characters in the</h1>

<p>file name</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<h2>Resolving the problem</h2>

<p>There is no way to fix a document name in the tooltip or security warning dialog
box. However, accepting the security warning opens the correct document.</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue to use non-English Unicode file names, knowing that the document file names will be
incorrect when the files are extracted from the case package zip file.</li>
<li>Include only those documents that do not have non-English Unicode file names in the case
package.</li>
<li>Rename the extracted document with the embedded non-English Unicode file name that is listed in
the case package PDF.</li>
<li>Ensure that the third-party utility you use to unzip the case package fully supports UTF-8
format file names.</li>
</ul>
