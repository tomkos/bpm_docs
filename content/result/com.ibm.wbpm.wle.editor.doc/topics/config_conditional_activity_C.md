# System services to implement conditional activities (deprecated)

The System Data toolkit provides ready-to-use services for implementing and managing conditional
activities. The primary service, lsw Conditional Activity Selection Coach ,
provides a sample heritage coach for selecting conditional activities at run time using a graphical
interface.

The System Data toolkit also includes a heritage coach to serve as a template for conditional
activities named lsw Save Conditional Activity Template Coach. This template for
conditional activities is specific to a single process definition. You can have multiple templates
per one process definition.
