<h1>Inconsistent behavior when adding the same property in multiple in-baskets in the same queue</h1>

<p>with different object types</p>

<p>For example, you add a property to the All Assigned Work in-basket as a case and then add the
same property to the My Work in-basket as a task. After you save and close the solution, the
property is still set as a task in both in-baskets.</p>

<p>To work around this issue, save and close the solution before you change the object type of a
property that is used in multiple in-baskets.</p>
