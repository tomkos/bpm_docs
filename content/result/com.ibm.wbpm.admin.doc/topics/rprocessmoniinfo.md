| Active Processes Currently Executing     | Process name, which includes the instance ID, enter time (start time), duration (running time), and total number of steps for each process instance currently running on this server. In addition to processes that are running smoothly, this category also includes currently running processes that might have problems. For example, if a process instance is stuck in a repeating loop, it is shown in this list.                                   |
| Active Processes Not Currently Executing | Name, last enter time (most recent start time), last duration (running time from most recent execution), total duration (cumulative running time), and total number of steps for processes that were previously started, but not currently active, on this server. This category includes process instances that are active but not running at this moment. For example, if a process instance is waiting for an event, it is included in this category. |
| Completed Processes                      | Name, last enter time (most recent start time), last duration (running time from most recent execution), total duration (cumulative running time), and total number of steps for processes that ran successfully on this server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Active Services Currently Executing                        | Name, enter time (start time), duration (running time), and total number of steps for each service currently running on this server.  In addition to services that are running smoothly, this category also includes currently running services that might have problems. For example, if a service is stuck in a repeating loop, it is shown in this list.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Active Services Not Currently Executing/Completed Services | Name, last enter time (most recent start time), last duration (running time from most recent execution), total duration (cumulative running time), and total number of steps for services that were previously started, but not currently active, on this server and for services that ran successfully on this server. This category includes two types of services:  Services that completed successfully  Services that were previously started but are not currently running. For example, if a service is waiting for an event, it is included in this category. |
