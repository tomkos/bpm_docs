# Searches in Workplace

- When you use basic searches to customize your task, workflow, and case list views, you narrow
the scope of your search, combine simple filters, and select and sort visible columns. You can only
use the AND keyword to combine simple field
operator
value filters in basic searches. To obtain the results that you want, you
might need to define and maintain multiple basic queries.
- For more refined results and to minimize the effort to maintain multiple queries, you can
consolidate more basic queries and use different ways to combine them into one more complex advanced
query that can be optimized. A single advanced query requires only one trip to the database and is
faster than running multiple smaller queries, which improves performance. Note: For the new Workplace advanced search feature
to work with both processes and cases, process and case instances must be indexed in the federated
data repository. For more information, see Administering the federated data repository indexes.

- Basic searches in Workplace

Use basic searches when you want to customize your task, workflow, and case list views by using simple search criteria. As part of the view customization, you can narrow the scope of your search, combine simple filters, and select and sort visible columns.
- Advanced searches in Workplace

You can use advanced searches in Workplace when you need more complex searches that cannot be built by using basic queries or when you want to aggregate multiple smaller queries into one query to reduce maintenance and improve performance. With advanced searches, you can sort and combine filters by using together keywords such as NOT, AND, and OR.
