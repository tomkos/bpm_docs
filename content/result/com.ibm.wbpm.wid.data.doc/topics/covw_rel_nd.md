# Relationships
in Network Deployment environments

In Network Deployment (ND) environments, relationships
are installed
in an application cluster. Relationships are then visible within the
cluster, and all servers in the cluster have access to the instance
data stored in the relationship database. The ability to run the relationship
service in an ND environment makes it scalable and highly available.

The relationship manager allows relationships to be managed across
different clusters through a centralized administrative interface.
You connect the relationship manager to a server in a cluster by selecting
its relationship MBean.
