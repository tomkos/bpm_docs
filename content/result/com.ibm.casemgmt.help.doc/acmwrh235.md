# Calendar widget

Alternatively, you can add the Show Calendar action to either the Case
Toolbar widget or the Case List widget. This action displays the calendar in a dialog box even if
you do not add the Calendar widget to a Case page.

If you add the Calendar widget to a page, you can configure the settings to display the calendar
in either a small-style or large-style format. Both styles provide visual cues to the user to
indicate any events that occur on a day. If a case worker clicks a date in the small-style calendar,
IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow opens a dialog box with the large-style calendar in day
view.

You can subscribe to internet calendars to display events from these calendars in case calendars.
In Case Builder, you can configure these subscriptions in the
Calendar widget settings for each case type. The events from the internet calendars then display in
the calendars for all cases of the specified case type. The URL you enter for a calendar
subscription must use a valid iCalendar (.ics) file format.

For the large-style calendar and the calendar that is displayed in the dialog box, case workers
can select the Manage calendar subscriptions option in Case Client to subscribe to other internet calendars. These subscriptions
apply only to the specific case where they are configured.

- Calendar widget events

The Calendar widget handles events to display a calendar that indicates due dates for quick tasks and target end dates for case stages.
