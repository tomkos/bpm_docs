|        | Activity           | Use this tool to add an activity to the heritage human service diagram. The following types of activities are available:  Coach A coach implements user interfaces that are displayed when you run the heritage human service. See Building coaches.    Server Script Task A script uses JavaScript to access and manipulate data. If you need to generate large amounts of text, you can switch the script to a scriptlet in the Properties view. The script language is JavaScript, except that in scriptlets, the syntax is as described in Using scriptlets in script tasks. For more information about the JavaScript API, see JavaScript API. For information about adding global JavaScript functions as managed server files, see Managing external files.    Content Integration Task A content integration activity integrates with Enterprise Content Management (ECM) servers. See Building a service that integrates with an ECM system or a BPM store.    Modify Task A modify task enables you to specify values for a number of runtime configuration properties of a task. You can customize task properties such as the due date and duration, priority, status, subject, and who can work on the task. See Modifying tasks.    Postpone Task A postpone task halts the execution of a specified task and keeps the task in a suspended state until it can be resumed at a later moment. See Enabling work to be postponed and resumed at run time.    Nested Service A nested service calls another heritage human service, service flow, or heritage service such as an Ajax, General System, Integration, or Advanced Integration service. When the nested service activity is triggered at run time, the nested service is run. After the nested service is completed, the parent heritage human service resumes execution. See Calling another service from a heritage human service.                                   |
|        | Exclusive Gateway  | Use a gateway to split the execution path of the heritage human service. An exclusive gateway follows only one of several paths, depending on a condition; that is, it is mutually exclusive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|        | Intermediate Event | Use this tool to add an intermediate event to the heritage human service diagram. The following types of events are available:   Message (sending) An outgoing message event sends a message to an undercover agent (UCA) while the heritage human service flow is running. You can configure the message event so that the incoming message is received only by a process that is in the same process application snapshot as this event. If the heritage human service is in a toolkit, the snapshot of the root process application is used. Multiple message events are supported. See Sending messages to undercover agents.    Error An error intermediate event catches errors. When you attach the event to the boundary of an activity, the error boundary event catches errors that occur when the activity to which it is attached runs. The error boundary event catches all the runtime and business errors. Each error boundary event must have an outgoing link. When you use the event as a stand-alone error event, it catches all the errors that are not caught by boundary event handlers. See Catching errors by using error boundary events.    Stay on Page A stay-on-page event loops the service diagram back to the previous running coach without drawing a connection to it. The stay-on-page event returns the control back to the coach, so that any variable updates made since the coach boundary event are refreshed on the same user interface page.  Warning: For information about an unsupported scenario that uses a stay-on-page event that follows a postpone task or nested service in the context of the migration of a process instance, see Troubleshooting user interfaces.     Tracking A tracking event indicates a point in the heritage human service at which you want Business Automation Workflow to capture the runtime data for reporting purposes. See Enabling runtime data tracking . |
|        | End Event          | Use an end event to end the heritage human service flow. The following types of end events are available:  None Ends the activities on a particular path.    Error An error end event throws an error and ends the processing of the heritage human service. To throw a specific error, in the Implementation properties of the error end event, set the error properties by specifying the error code and mapping the error end event to a specified variable. See Throwing errors in service flows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|        | Note               | Use a note to add textual information to a heritage human service diagram. You can add notes that explain parts of your human service, development notes, or information that is relevant to a specified step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
