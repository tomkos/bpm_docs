# Adding new activities for a case

## About this task

- Automatic workflow activities are started automatically.
- Manual workflow activities are started manually. Tip: Using the added support for
workflow process activities that are designated as manual, you can start a process activity by
clicking Start in the Activities tab of the Case
Information widget. If the process has a launch UI, the launch UI page is automatically opened when
the activity is started.
- Discretionary workflow activities typically are used for activities that are routinely performed
for a case but might not be performed regularly. These activities are predefined for a solution, but
are not automatically added to cases. Instead, you add discretionary workflow activities to a case
only as necessary.
- Custom workflow activities address activities that are not typically part of a case. You can
define these activities to meet specific case requirements.

- Adding discretionary workflow activities

Discretionary workflow activities are defined for specific types of cases. Typically, they are used for situations that happen frequently, but not as part of every case. For example, a discretionary workflow activity might be used to initiate a fraud investigation for an insurance claim. The work items that are required to complete this investigation are predefined for the discretionary workflow activity.
- Adding discretionary to-do tasks

Discretionary to-do tasks are defined for specific types of cases. Typically, they are used for simple activities that are not associated with a workflow and that happen frequently, but not as part of every case. For example, a discretionary to-do task might be used to record the completion of making contact by telephone with a client.
- Adding quick tasks

Quick tasks are simple activities that you define and add to a case. You can use quick tasks to organize your work, track one-time tasks, or similar activities. For example, you might create a quick task to make a follow-up call to a client or to locate files that are needed for the case.
- Adding custom activities

You can add a custom activity for an activity that is not handled by the discretionary activities that are predefined for a case. For example, you might add a custom activity to review a document that is not typically associated with a case.
