# Managing work in Workplace

- Starting Workplace

You can start Workplace in several different ways.
- Setting preferences

Your user profile settings contain your contact information and preferences that you can set for working with Workplace and receiving notifications.
- Searches in Workplace

You use searches, filters, and sorting options to manage your work items and customize your task and workflow list views in Workplace. In addition to basic searches, you can now define advanced searches that help you consolidate multiple search queries into one and refine your search results in a single query that uses a specific syntax and keywords such as AND, NOT, and OR together.
- Managing work

You can work on tasks or participate in processes and cases to complete structured and unstructured work. If you're a manager, you can also manage the work of the teams that you're responsible for, and use dashboards to evaluate your teams' workload and act on their performance.
