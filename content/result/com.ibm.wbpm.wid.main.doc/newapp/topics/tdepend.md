# Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies on libraries, Javaâ„¢ projects, and Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition projects.

## Procedure

To add a dependency, complete the following steps:

1. In the Business Integration view, double-click the Dependencies artifact under the module, mediation module,
or library from which you want to add a dependency. The dependency editor opens.
2. Depending on what you need to add, expand the Library, Java, or J2EE section in the Dependency editor.  Tip: You
can add Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition project dependencies only for modules and mediation modules.
3. Click Add to add the library or
project.
4. In the selection window, click the library or project and
click OK to add it as a dependent.  In the dependency editor, the resource shows in the container.
5. Select a newly added Java or Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition project in the container to see the Deploy with
Module setting and, for Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition projects, the On Build Path setting. You can clear either of these
check boxes to remove dependencies. See related concepts for more
information on dependencies.
