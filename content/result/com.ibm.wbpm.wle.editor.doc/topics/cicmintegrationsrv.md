# Integrating BPDs with IBM Business Automation
Workflow cases
(deprecated)

You might also want to consider including cases in your process
applications so that they run directly on an Business Automation Workflow process
server. For more information, see Building process applications.

- Adding an IBM Business Automation Workflow server (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
You require at least one IBM Business Automation Workflow server to build an IBM Business Automation Workflow Integration service.
- Building the IBM Business Automation Workflow integration service (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Like other integration services, this service integrates with another system. Specifically, this service integrates a business process developed in IBM Process Designer with an IBM Business Automation Workflow case management solution.
- Building a query for a search case operation (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
A graphical interface helps you build a query to your IBM Business Automation Workflow solution.
- Processing a search case operation result (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
A search case operation result is often used with an update case operation. Since an array is returned in a search case result, you would use JavaScript to iterate through each element of the array and perform multiple updates.
- Data mapping in case operations (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Each case operation requires that variables, or values in the case of input, be mapped to the input and output fields. Using the auto-map function creates variables, if required, and assigns variables of the right type to each field.
- Accessing an IBM Business Automation Workflow server using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Some IBM Business Automation Workflow servers may use SSL for security protection.
