- Visualizing BPD data (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Use the data visualization option in IBM® Process Designer to create a visual representation of a selected business process definition (BPD). The visualization is displayed in a new web browser window. It contains the web-based diagram view of the BPD. Select the required data variables or tag groups that you want to visualize on the left side in the browser window.
- Authentication during playback to handle changes in user identity (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Process applications can use Process Designer capabilities that you can access only from your locally installed Process Designer and some capabilities that you can access only on the web. This topic describes the behavior that occurs when you have an artifact open in the web browser and you do a playback from within the Process Designer installed locally on your computer.
