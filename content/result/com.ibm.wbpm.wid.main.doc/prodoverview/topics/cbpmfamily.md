# Introduction to IBM Integration
Designer

Use IBMÂ® Integration
Designer to produce
complex automated processes that are capable of interacting with large, back-end systems and
services.

A business process is a set of related activities that produces
an output that no activity would produce individually. Today, software
is an important part of the business process management environment.
Software allows a business to model its processes. Then the model
can be automated by integrating applications in the business process
instead of manual work. During run time, a business process created
with software can also be monitored when in use and the efficiency
of the business process model improved.
