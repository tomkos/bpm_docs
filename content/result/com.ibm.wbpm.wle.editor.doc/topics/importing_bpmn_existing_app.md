# Importing BPMN 2.0 artifacts into an existing process application in the desktop Process Designer

## About this task

You can import BPMN 2.0 files that you exported from Blueworks Live or from another product. If you import the same BPMN artifacts multiple times,
those actions result in multiple copies of the generated BPM artifacts.Â Each import is
self-contained and does not overwrite the results of prior imports.

## Procedure

1. Start desktop Process Designer.
2. Open a process application.
3. Package the BPMN 2.0 file that you want to import in a .zip file.
4. Click File > Import.  The Import BPMN 2.0 File  window
opens.
5. Click Browse and select the BPMN 2.0 file that you want to import, and
then click OK.

## Results

The Import Results window opens showing
generated error, warning, and information messages. All the artifacts
are imported into the existing process application.

In the library,
all artifacts that are imported from the BPMN 2.0 file are marked
with an Imported tag.
