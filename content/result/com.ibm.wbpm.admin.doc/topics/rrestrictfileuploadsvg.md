# Restrictions on large file uploads and SVG browser display for ECM and BPM
documents

- The maximum file size for document uploads through views in the Content Management toolkit is 100 MB.
- SVG documents cannot be directly viewed in the browser, but can be downloaded instead.

These restrictions add to the default configuration, which prevented viewing text or HTML content
directly in the browser. If you have an environment configured with additional document
restrictions, they still apply and the default will not take effect. However, if you have not
customized the document restrictions, the newly expanded set of default restrictions will take
effect.
