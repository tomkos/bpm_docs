create one if necessary by clicking New), a
folder and a name for the new decision table, and click Next.
4. In the select an interface and operation window, browse
to an existing rule group, or click New to
create one. If necessary, use the drop down lists to select

5. If you want to configure the layout of the decision table,

## Results

- Decision table editor

A decision table captures multi-conditional decision-making business logic in tabular format.
- Working with conditions in a decision table

A condition is an evaluation of the incoming message that looks for a specific value.
- Configuring actions in a decision table

An action is an operation that is executed when the appropriate conditions are met.
- Working with initialization action rules

An initialization action rule automatically performs an operation of some kind when data is first being passed to a decision table.
- Using an otherwise condition

An otherwise condition is used in a decision table for situations when the specified conditions will not be met. The otherwise condition cause a rule to fire when no other evaluation can be resolved.
- Changing the layout of your decision table

Some decision tables are easier to understand if you change their orientation.
- Creating decision table templates

Use a template to define the implementation and parameters for either a condition or an action value in a decision table. This template can then be used to create new cells with the same format, but with different parameter values.
- Using templates in your decision table

The individual cells of your decision table can be populated with an existing template for the value. In this way, you can create a similar expression without having to redefine the implementation, and by making changes to the parameters within the constraints specified.
