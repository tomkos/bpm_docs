# Artifact support in traditional and container runtime environments

The following table lists the artifacts that are supported in the traditional runtime environment
and the container runtime environment. All of these artifacts are editable in the web Process Designer, the deprecated desktop Process Designer, or both. For information about editing these
artifacts in the web or desktop Process Designer, or
for information on converting these artifacts to other formats (where applicable), see Where to edit Process Designer artifacts.
