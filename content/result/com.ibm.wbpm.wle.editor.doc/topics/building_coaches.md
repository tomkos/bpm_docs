# Building heritage coaches (deprecated)

In the first stage of designing a heritage coach, your goal may be to build a mock-up with static
elements so that you can visualize what data is needed in the runtime heritage coach, and where the
data should be displayed in the layout. After you have designed the look and feel of the heritage
coach, you need to feed real business data to the heritage coach controls for your process
participants to interact with and to help them make the appropriate decisions. This requires
creating bindings between the heritage coach controls and the data structures (variables) that
represent the business data within your IBM® BPM
processes.
