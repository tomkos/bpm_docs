# Icons and symbols

In the event definition editor, icons are images
that are used to invoke actions. Symbols, by comparison, are
images that simply represent workbench elements and they are not used
to invoke actions.

For example, you can add a property to an event definition
by clicking the Add Property icon . However, you cannot perform any action by clicking
the parent property symbol .

The event
definition editor icons and symbols are described in the following
table:
