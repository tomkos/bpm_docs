<h1>Customizing the case package PDF file</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>Case workers can create a case package to share details about a case with external stakeholders
who do not have access to the case management system. For example, the case might need to be sent to
a legal advisor for review. From the Case Details or Cases
page, case workers can select properties, documents, related cases, and other case information such
as case comments and history, and package them into a single compressed file that is saved in the
case folder. The case package contains the selected case documents and a PDF file that lists the
selected case information.</p>

<p>You can customize the appearance of the PDF file by modifying the
casepackage.xsl stylesheet file that is used by Apache FOP (Formatting Objects
Processor) version 2.0 to generate the PDF file. For more information about customizing the
stylesheet, see the Apache FOP documentation at https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/.</p>
