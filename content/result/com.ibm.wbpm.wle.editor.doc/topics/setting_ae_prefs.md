# Setting preferences in the desktop Process Designer
(deprecated)

## About this task

The following steps describe how to access the preference
settings and the following table describes the options that are available.

To set the locale for IBM Workflow
Center and Process Designer, access Workflow Center by opening your web
browser to the following location: http://[host\_name]:[port]/ProcessCenter.
Click Preferences in the upper right corner and choose the language that you
want from the list. When you change the locale, you must exit and then restart IBM Process
Designer for the change to
take effect. (When you are accessing Workflow Center from a browser, you
can log out and then log back in for the change to take effect.)

The locale preference that is selected applies
to the user who is logged in. Each IBM Business Automation Workflow interface
that is started by the same user in the same environment uses this
preference setting.

## Procedure

To set preferences:

1. Select File > Preferences from the main menu.
2. Click the Business Automation Workflow entry
to display the available options.
3. Click the option that you want.  For example,
to set the user name for Blueworks
Live process subscriptions, click the Blueworks Live option.

Option
Description

Blueworks Live
Set the Blueworks
Live server URL and email address for Blueworks Live process subscriptions.Tip: Changing the email address or the URL logs you out of Blueworks Live.

Capabilities
Control the capabilities of the current user. For example,
to create external activities in IBM Process
Designer,
you must enable Business Automation Workflow Developer
Capability and Business Automation Workflow Advanced
Features.

User Interfaces
Select whether to open coach views and heritage human
services in the desktop editor or the web editor by default.

Decisions
Control the locale setting for BAL Rules.

JavaScript

Optimizer Settings
Set options for the Optimizer. For example, the KPI thresholds
that are used by the Visualization Modes are the thresholds from the
current working version of your process application or toolkit. If
you want to use the KPI thresholds from the snapshot (version) of
your process application or toolkit that was most recently run and
tracked, change the Optimizer to the following preference setting: Use
the KPI threshold values from the actual version of the Process App/Toolkit.

Passwords
Manage the passwords that are stored when running tasks from
the Inspector.

Web Browser
Select the web browser to use when web pages are opened from IBM Process
Designer.
If you do not see a particular external web browser as an option,
click New to add it.
