# Hiring tutorial

You can access the tutorial in IBM developerWorks at Hiring tutorial: Create the process application.

The
Hiring Sample process application that you create using the tutorial
is similar to the Hiring Sample process application that is in Workflow Center. Any
differences are minor in nature.
