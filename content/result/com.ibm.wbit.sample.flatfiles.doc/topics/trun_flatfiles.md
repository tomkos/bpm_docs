# Run the sample

If you imported the ready-made sample, you need to create
the directories and add an input file as shown in Create the directories and input file. You also need
to import the WebSphere Adapter
for Flat Files as shown in Import the adapter.

- Optionally Print the PDF version of this sample. You may have imported the sample and want to
run it. Looking at the PDF version, you will see how the sample was created.
- If you imported the sample rather than built it yourself, import the WebSphere for Flat Files adapter.
- Deploy the module to the server
- Run and test the module

- Import the adapter

Two versions of the sample are provided. One version includes the Flat File adapter in case you do not have it in your workspace yet. One version does not include the Flat File adapter. If previously you worked on the sample to create services that respond to Flat File events or you have worked with files that use the Flat File adapter, then the Flat File adapter is imported into the workspace for you. But if you need to import the adapter, the following steps are provided.
- Deploy the module

Deploy the module to the server so that you can test your application on the runtime.
- Test the module

Looking at the output in the console and in the output directory will tell you the success of the service you created.
