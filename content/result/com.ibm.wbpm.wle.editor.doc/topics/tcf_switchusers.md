# Authentication during playback to handle changes in user identity (deprecated)

## About this task

- When you claim a task that is currently assigned to a team that
you belong to, you are prompted to select the user name that you will
run the task as. You can choose to run the task as the logged-in user
or as a different user. The logged-in user is selected by default.
- The task is run in a web browser and you are logged in to the
web browser using the selected user name.
- If you select a different user name, ensure that the different
user belongs to a user group that has read or write access to that
process application.
- If a playback action is performed using a different user name,
you are notified that you will be logged out of your browser session
to allow you to complete the playback action as the different user.
- After the playback action is complete, you are prompted to log
back in to the web browser.
