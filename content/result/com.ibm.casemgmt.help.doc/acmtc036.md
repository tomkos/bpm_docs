# Errors in Case Client property settings

Users might encounter error conditions on number spinner properties, date, or datetime field
properties.

- If you encounter an error in a number spinner field, click the arrows to the correct value, or
edit the numbers directly.
- If you encounter an error with a date or datetime field, you can edit the value with the
calendar tool or by using the keyboard. To use the keyboard, tab out of the field and then use the
Shift + Tab back into the field. You can then use the arrow key to position the cursor at the point
where you want to edit.
