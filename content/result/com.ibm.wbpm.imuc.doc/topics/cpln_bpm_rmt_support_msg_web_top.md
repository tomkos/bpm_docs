# Application, Messaging, and Support topology pattern

The Application, Messaging, and Support topology pattern is the preferred topology for IBMÂ® Business Process
Manager Server.

- Workflow Server
- Business Rules manager
- Business Space
- Process Portal
- REST API Services

The messaging infrastructure cluster hosts a single
service integration bus and single messaging engine that use the same
database schema as the product database by default. Each deployment
environment has its own bus. The single bus is called BPM.deployment\_environment\_name.Bus.

In a Application, Messaging, and Support topology pattern, the deployment environment functions
are divided among three separate clusters. One cluster is used for applications, one cluster is used
for messaging functionality, and one cluster for support functionality.
