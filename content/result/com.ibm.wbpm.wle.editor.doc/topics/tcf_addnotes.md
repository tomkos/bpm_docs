# Adding notes to client-side human services

## About this task

## Procedure

To add a note to a client-side human service:

1. Open the client-side human service you want to work with.
2. In the Diagram view, use the Note tool  to add a note to the
canvas.
3. Select the note and, under Note > Common, enter or paste the information that you want to include in the note.
To make the text fit inside the note, drag a corner to resize the note box. If the note is not
resized, the overflow text is replaced by an ellipsis.
4. Optional: If the information is relevant to a specified diagram node, connect
the note to that node. A dotted connection associates the note with the node. The
association is maintained if the node is renamed or moved on the canvas.
5. Click Save or Finish Editing.
