# Integration test client

- 1 Events page
- 2 Configurations page

Almost all of the tasks that you can perform in the integration
test client are either initiated or performed in one of the two pages.
The Events and Configurations pages are described in the topics "Events
page" and "Configurations page."

- Events page of the integration test client

In the Events page of the integration test client, you can perform numerous test activities to interact with your module during testing. You can select an operation to test, specify values for the operation, and invoke the operation.
- Value and data pool editors

In the integration test client, you can use a value editor to specify, view, edit, and pass values for operations, manual emulations, and event definitions. You can also save values to a data pool, where you can view and edit the values and later reuse them in the value editor.
- Configurations page of the integration test client

In the Configurations page of the integration test client, you can edit the default test configuration or you can create and edit new test configurations. You can add modules to your test configurations, or add emulators and monitors to your test configuration modules, to more precisely control your tests.
- Icons and symbols for the integration test client

In the integration test client and other IBM Integration Designer tools, icons are images that are used to invoke actions. Symbols, by comparison, are images that simply represent workbench elements and they are not used to invoke actions.
- Keyboard shortcuts for the integration test client

In the integration test client, you can perform many of the available test actions by using keyboard shortcuts.
