<h2>Before you begin</h2>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To add a step to assign workgroup members:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a lane for the new step.
Do not create a
workgroup lane for the workgroup that must be assigned. This step
must be completed by users who are assigned to a role or by users
who are assigned to a workgroup that already has members. That is,
there must be a known user who can complete this step.
The case worker is prompted to assign a user or group
to the workgroup when the work item is opened from the in-basket.</li>
<li>Add a step to the lane.</li>
<li>In the Step Properties section, select a workgroup from
the list.</li>
