<h1>Data objects</h1>

<li>Content objects</li>
</ul>

<p>A content object is a specialization of a complex business object. It is used to wrap a list of properties. Content objects are automatically created in Process Designer when you define corresponding case artifacts in Case Builder. You cannot create or edit a content object directly in Process Designer, and a content object cannot reference any regular business object that is created there.
- Case and activity properties</p>

<p>In Case Builder, you can define properties that you then use in a case or activity. Corresponding properties are automatically added in Process Designer, which enables business processes to access the case and activity properties in the parent case. You cannot create a case or activity property directly in Process Designer.</p>
