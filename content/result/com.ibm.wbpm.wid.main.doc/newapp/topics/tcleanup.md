# Keeping the workspace clean

In IBMÂ® Integration
Designer,
there are numerous ways to maintain a clean workspace. For example,
whenever you delete certain kinds of primary workspace resources,
you can choose to have their supporting artifacts automatically deleted
rather than having them retained and unused in the workspace.

## About this task

If
you want to create a new XML map for a Mapping primitive but an XML map already exists, you can
create the new XML map and simultaneously choose whether to have the existing XML map overridden,
deleted, or retained. This is described in the topic "Creating an XML map."

Another way to
keep your workspace clean and organized is to keep the names of your components synchronized with
the names of their associated component implementations. This is easily accomplished in the assembly
editor. When you refactor and rename a component in the assembly editor, you are given the option of
renaming just the component or renaming both the component and its implementation. This is described
in the topic "Renaming
components."
