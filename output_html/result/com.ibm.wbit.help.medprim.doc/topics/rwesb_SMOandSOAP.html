<h1>Accessing SOAP header information in the SMO</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Messages received from a web
services import or export might include
SOAP headers from the original SOAP message. The SOAP headers are
placed in the /headers/SOAPHeader element in
the headers section of the service message object (SMO).</p>

<p>A SOAPHeader element
is a wrapper that contains the original SOAP header as its value element. The element can have zero or more occurrences. The
XML namespace-qualified name of the SOAP header type appears in the name and nameSpace elements
of the SOAPHeader .</p>

<h2>SDO paths for accessing SOAP headers in custom mediations</h2>

<ul>
<li>To access all SOAP headers present in the SMO:import commonj.sdo.DataObject;
import java.util.List;</li>
</ul>

<p>DataObject smo = ...
List soapHeaders = smo.getList ("/headers/SOAPHeader");
Iterator it = soapHeaders.iterator ();</p>

<p>while (it.hasNext ())
{
    DataObject wrapper = (DataObject) it.next ();
    Object header = wrapper.get ("value");</p>

<pre><code>// do something with the header
</code></pre>

<p>}The list of SOAP headers might be an empty list.
- To access a SOAP header with a particular name (global element
or type name): import commonj.sdo.DataObject;
import java.util.List;</p>

<p>String headerName = ...
DataObject smo = ...
Object header = smo.get ("/headers/SOAPHeader[name='" + headerName + "']/value");</p>

<h2>Conditions under which SOAP headers are present in</h2>

<p>a request or response flow</p>

<ul>
<li>The message has been received from a web service import or export.</li>
<li>The import or export has been configured to
propagate protocol headers.</li>
<li>The sending application included SOAP headers when creating the
original request.</li>
<li><p>An XML schema or WSDL description of the header structures is
present in the mediation module or in the associated
library.Note: The XML schema for WS-Addressing
headers is automatically available.</p></li>
<li><p>If the SOAP binding used by the client maps WSDL message parts
to SOAP headers, the corresponding content appears in the SMO body
rather than in the SOAPHeader element.</p></li>
<li>WS-Addressing headers appear in the SMO
WSAHeader and not the SOAPHeader. These headers are read-only and
are not used when sending messages..</li>
</ul>
