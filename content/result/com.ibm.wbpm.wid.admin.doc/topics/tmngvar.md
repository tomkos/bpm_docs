# Managing test variations

## About this task

- Showing variable type logical structures in the integration debugger

In the Variables view of the integration debugger, the logical structure of some variable types is shown by default. This includes Java types associated with business object data maps, business rules, and decision tables. However, you can choose to expand the content of the Variables view to show the full implementation details of the variable types.
- Showing variable or message type names in the integration debugger

In the Variables view of the Debug perspective, you can choose to either show or hide the type names of all listed variables or messages, such as the Javaâ„¢ type names String, int, or boolean.
- Changing variable or message values in the integration debugger

In the Debug perspective, all variables or messages associated with a selected stack frame are displayed in the Variables view. You can change the value of many (but not all) variables and messages.
- Evaluating expressions in the integration debugger

If you are debugging a business process in the integration debugger and execution suspends at a breakpoint in a Java snippet, you can evaluate expressions in the context of a stack frame.
- Creating test variations

When you create a new test variation for a test case, you can choose to create a default test variation in which all of the variables in the test data table are automatically set to their default values. Alternatively, you can choose to create a test variation by copying the variable values from an existing test variation.
- Removing test variations

You can remove any unused test variations that are open in the Test Data Table view of the test suite editor. This enables you to more easily manage the remaining test variations.
