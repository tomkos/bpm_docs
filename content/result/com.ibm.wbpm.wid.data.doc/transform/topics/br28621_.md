# Grouping transforms into nested maps

## About this task

When the Group transforms
into nested maps property is selected, the Auto map wizard
attempts to place new transforms inside new Local Map transforms.
The Auto map wizard recursively analyzes the input and output elements
of the new transforms, searching for a common input ancestor and a
common output ancestor. If a common input ancestor is found for the
input elements, and a common output ancestor is found for the output
elements, a new Local Map transform is created between them. Inside
the new local map, when no more common ancestors can be found, the
new transforms are created at this level. If there are still some
common ancestors at a given level, the process is repeated.

```
SomeInput
--Resources
---field1
---field2
---field3
---field4
```

```
SomeOutput
---Items
----field1
----field2
----field3
----field4
```

However, if the Group transforms into nested maps property is selected,
the Auto map wizard creates a Local Map transform between SomeInput/Resources and SomeOutput/Items at the current level of the map, and then creates transforms between
the input and output elements field1, field2, field3, and field4 inside the
local map.
