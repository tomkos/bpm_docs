# AUDIT\_LOG\_B view

Inline tasks are logged in both the AUDIT\_LOG\_B view and
in the TASK\_AUDIT\_LOG view. For example, claiming an inline participating
task results in a TASK\_CLAIMED event and an ACTIVITY\_CLAIMED event.
All other task types are only logged in the TASK\_AUDIT\_LOG view. Depending
on the choices made in IBMÂ® Integration
Designer, inline human tasks can also trigger Common Event Infrastructure
(CEI) events to be emitted for Business Flow Manager staff activity
events and Human Task Manager task events.

Audit events are
related to process entities. The audit event types depend on the entity
to which the event refers. The audit event types include:

- Process template events (PTE)
- Process instance events (PIE)
- Activity instance events (AIE)
- Events related to variables (VAR)
- Control link events (CLE)
- Scope-related events (SIE).

The following table describes the AUDIT\_LOG\_B view.
It lists the names of the columns, the event types, and gives a short
description for the column.
