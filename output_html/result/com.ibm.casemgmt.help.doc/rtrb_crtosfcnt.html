<h1>createObjectStoreForContent fails to run</h1>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>If the createObjectStoreForContent command fails, perform the
following steps to clean the design object store and target object store:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to the ACCE to remove the design object store and target object store if they are
available.</li>
<li>Drop the design object store and target object store databases.
3 If your Db2® type is z/OS®, drop the related sequences: DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.AUDITSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.CISEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.REPLSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.SCFSEQUENCE; DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.AUDITSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.CISEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.REPLSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.SCFSEQUENCE; DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.AUDITSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.CISEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.REPLSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.SCFSEQUENCE; where:</li>
</ol>

<p>```
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.AUDITSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.CISEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.REPLSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.SCFSEQUENCE;</p>

<p>DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.AUDITSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.CISEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.REPLSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.SCFSEQUENCE;</p>

<p>DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.AUDITSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.CISEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.REPLSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.SCFSEQUENCE;
```</p>

<pre><code>- SYSADM is the user that you use to connect to Db2 for z/OS.
- DOSCT is the database schema of the design object store in your
</code></pre>

<p>BPMConfig property file.
    - TOSCT is the database schema of the target object store in your
BPMConfig property file.
4. Recreate the design object store and target object store databases.</p>
