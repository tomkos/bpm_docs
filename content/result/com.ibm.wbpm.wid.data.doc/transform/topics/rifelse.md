# XML transform: If, Else if, and Else transforms

- For each conditional transform in the group, enter a condition
in the Conditions tab in the Properties view. The condition must be
in the form of an XPath expression.
- To change the order in which the conditions are evaluated, select
the conditional group and click the Order tab and use the up and down
arrows.
- Double-click the conditional transform (for example, if)
to create the mapping that will run for the condition.
