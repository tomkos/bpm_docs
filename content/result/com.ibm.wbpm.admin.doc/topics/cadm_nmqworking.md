# Administering WebSphere MQ bindings

Use the administrative console to access WebSphereÂ® MQ
bindings.

For detailed instructions on generating WebSphere MQ imports and exports, see Generating an MQ JMS import binding and Generating
an MQ JMS export binding in the Integration Designer information
center.

- Viewing and updating WebSphere MQ bindings

You can administer WebSphere MQ import and export bindings to tune, or set, special features of the resource. The administrative tasks are performed using the administrative console.
- Properties of WebSphere MQ bindings

The WebSphere MQ binding can be installed with all the necessary connection factories having been created during deployment, or they can be configured to point to a set of existing resources.
- Viewing or changing the state of an endpoint

You can use the administrative console to manage the state of endpoints associated with JMS bindings, WebSphere MQ JMS bindings, and WebSphere MQ bindings. For example, you can pause or resume an endpoint associated with one of those bindings.
- Migrating WebSphere MQ Bindings from version 6 to later versions

Migration is only required for WebSphere MQ bindings that contain pre-configured resources.
