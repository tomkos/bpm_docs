# Creating an export to implement an Advanced Integration Service

## Procedure

To create an export to implement an Advanced Integration
Service, follow these steps:

1. First associate a module with the process application containing
the unimplemented Advanced Integration Service if you have not done
so.
2. From the assembly editor palette, expand Inbound
Exports, select Advanced Integration Service and
drag it onto the canvas. Select the Advanced Integration Service that
can be implemented from the window.
3. Click OK. An SCA export, one with
an SCA binding, is created in the assembly editor that is associated
with the Advanced Integration Service in Process Designer. It has
no implementation.
4. An alternate way to create the export is to drag the unimplemented
Advanced Integration Service from the Business Integration view
on to the assembly editor canvas. An export with no implementation
is created.
