# Task tags

A task tag is a predefined artifact that identifies an action that
must be completed. Task tags also have priority levels. For example,
a task tag can be named, FIXME, with a high priority level assigned
to it.

Task tags remind you of tasks that must be completed. For example,
you can attach a task tag to a loan fulfillment human task to remind
a developer to set up a decision matrix.

You can find default task tags by switching to the Java perspective,
and then selecting Window > Preferences Java > Compiler
> Task Tags. You can create your own task tags in the
same area.
