## Editor area

<!-- image -->

When you open a business object map in the editor area,
you can compose its contents and define its behavior.

Graphical
editors work with the Properties view to show the properties of selected
objects on the canvas.

Note also that you can drag resources
from the Business Integration view to the canvas of the business object
map editor to further work with them.

## Properties view

When using the Properties view with
editors, you can also modify the properties of selected item in the
editor.

## Outline view

The Outline view displays all objects in
the currently selected, or "active" editor. When you click an item
in the Outline view, the editor area and Properties view are synchronized
to show the selected item.

## References view

## Problems view
