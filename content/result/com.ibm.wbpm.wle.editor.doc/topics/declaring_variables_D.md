# Mapping input and output data for an activity in a service flow

## Before you begin

## About this task

When developing service flows, you must set the input and output mapping for each activity
included in a service flow so that the variable values received and generated by the services that
implement the activities map to the variables from the main service flow.

The following procedure describes how to map both input and output data for an activity.
Depending on the logic of your service flow, an activity may only require input or output data and
not both.

## Procedure

1. Open the service flow.
2. Click the activity in the diagram, and then click the Data Mapping
tab in the properties. The Data Mapping tab displays the
variables that are available from the service that is implemented in the activity or
step.
3. To complete the data mapping, click the Magic wand icon in both the
Input Mapping and Output Mapping sections.

If your variable is a shared business object, then the output mapping from the activity or step
is not required.
4. Click Save or Finish Editing.
