<h1>Service Invoke mediation primitive</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When you use the Service Invoke mediation primitive
inside a mediation flow, the input message is used to call the service.
If the call is successful, the response, or a section of the response
identified by one or more XPath expressions, is used to create the
output message. If the call is unsuccessful, you can retry the same
service, or call another service.</p>

<p>You can have multiple Service
Invoke mediation primitives inside one mediation flow. Therefore,
you can have a series of service calls. You can use the Service Invoke
mediation primitive in a request or response mediation flow.</p>

<p>Generally,
the initial service that the Service Invoke mediation primitive calls
is defined by the reference operation, which is a combination of the Reference
name property and the Operation name property. For
a Service Invoke mediation primitive in a subflow, the reference is
defined on the subflow and resolved to a reference in the parent flow
when an instance of the subflow is created.</p>

<p>The Service Invoke mediation primitive
has one input terminal (in) and multiple output
terminals. There is a fail terminal (fail)
for unmodeled faults, and one output terminal for each modeled fault.
Modeled faults are those that are explicitly listed in a WSDL file;
any other fault is an unmodeled fault. In addition, there is an output
terminal (out), which is used for successful
service calls, and a timeout terminal (timeout),
which is used for some types of asynchronous calls. Output terminals
that are created for a specific reason are classified as dynamic
terminals. For example, a WSDL-defined fault causes a dynamic
output terminal to be created.</p>

<ul>
<li>To use the default mode, ensure that the Message Enrichment
mode check box is clear.</li>
<li>To enable the Message Enrichment mode, select the Message
Enrichment mode check box.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details (default</h2>

<p>mode)</p>

<p>In default mode, the input message,
which is received at the in terminal, is passed
directly to the service, and the response message from the service
invocation is passed directly to the out terminal.
The body and header sections of the response message are propagated
to the output message.</p>

<ul>
<li>The message type of the in terminal must
match the request message type of the reference operation.</li>
<li>If there is a response message, the message type of the out terminal
must match the response message type of the reference operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following figure shows the message flow in default
mode, for a two-way operation.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the operation of the terminals
of the mediation primitive in default mode.</p>

<h2>Details (Message</h2>

<p>Enrichment mode)</p>

<p>In Message Enrichment mode,
a section of the input message, which is received at the in terminal
of the Service Invoke mediation primitive, is used for the service
invocation. The output message that passes through the out terminal
is constructed by merging the response from the service with the original
request message that was passed into the mediation primitive.</p>

<p>The message type of the in and out terminals
must match, but the type is initially not set. When the in terminal
is wired, its message type is defined implicitly by the input message,
and this message type is propagated to the out terminals.</p>

<p>The
following figure shows how the message is enriched as it flows through
the mediation primitive in a two-way operation.</p>

<li>Re-send the initial request to the initial service.</li>
<li>Send the initial request to an alternate service.</li>
<li>Send a new request to the initial service.</li>
<li><p>Send a new request to an alternate service.</p></li>
<li><p>Service Invoke mediation primitive properties</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can specify values for mediation primitive properties either by using the property fields in the IBMÂ® Integration Designer user interface or by using an XML format. The property field names displayed in IBM Integration Designer are generally different from the property names used when building a mediation flow using XML code. In the following information, icons are used to identify each property name used in IBM Integration Designer and the corresponding XML name. (Where applicable, XML names that are required, but not shown in IBM Integration Designer, are also described.)
- Service Invoke message propagation</p>

<p>When the Service Invoke mediation primitive is used to invoke a service, the service message objects (SMOs) in the request, response, and ouput messages are populated based on the mode configured for the mediation primitive.

<p>Usage patterns for the Service Invoke mediation primitive.
- How to process mediations in parallel</p>

<p>The Service Invoke mediation primitive allows parallel processing of mediations. While you are waiting for a service call to complete you can carry on processing other mediations in the mediation flow.
- Comparison of Service Invoke and callout</p>

<p>The Service Invoke mediation primitive can be compared to embedding a callout in the mediation flow.</p>
