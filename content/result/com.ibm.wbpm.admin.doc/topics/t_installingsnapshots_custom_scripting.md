# Installing snapshots onto an offline server using wsadmin commands
and custom installation packages

## Before you begin

If you plan to
migrate running instances, check that there is a migration policy for the snapshot. The migration
policy defines how to handle orphaned tokens if any exist. If a migration policy is not listed for
the source snapshot, notify the owner of the snapshot that your are installing to create the
migration policy. The snapshot owner can use Workflow Center to generate the
migration policy file and use the migration policy editor to modify it. For information, see Defining the migration policy by using the Process Center console.

## Procedure

1. On IBM Workflow
Center, create the
installation package by running the BPMCreateOfflinePackage command in the
profile\_root/bin directory, for example

AdminTask.BPMCreateOfflinePackage('[-containerAcronym HSS -containerSnapshotAcronym SHSV856 -containerTrackAcronym Main -serverName "Dev1" -skipGovernance false]')

The result of the command is a server-specific installation package file
(.zip).
2. Export the installation package by using the BPMExtractOfflinePackage
command, for example

AdminTask.BPMExtractOfflinePackage('[-containerAcronym HSS -containerSnapshotAcronym SHSV856 -containerTrackAcronym Main -serverName Dev1 -outputFile C:/myProcessApps/SHSV856.zip]')

For information about the command, see BPMExtractOfflinePackage command.
3. For each snapshot you want to migrate instances from, export the migration policy by running
the BPMExtractMigrationPolicy command.
The migration policy file is a standard XML file that you can open and edit if necessary, for
example

AdminTask.BPMExtractMigrationPolicy('[-containerAcronym HSS -containerSourceSnapshotAcronym V1 -containerTargetSnapshotAcronym V2 -outputFile C:\migrationPolicy\V1\_to\_V2.xml]')

For information about the command, see BPMExtractMigrationPolicy command.
4. Using FTP or a similar utility, transfer the installation
package (.zip) and any migration policy files
(.xml) to the server that hosts the new snapshot
or to a central location that the server can access.
5. On the workflow server, install the snapshot by running the
BPMInstallPackage command in the
profile\_root/bin directory.
For
example:AdminTask.BPMInstallPackage('[-inputFile C:/myProcessApps/SHSV856.zip -showSnapshotInfo true]')
Instead of using the BPMInstallPackage command, you can also use the
BPMInstallOfflinePackage command. While BPMInstallPackage
handles both custom and generic installation packages as input,
BPMInstallOfflinePackage handles only custom installation packages.
BPMInstallOfflinePackage exists to support scripts that were created for Business Automation Workflow V8.5.5 or earlier. For information about the
commands, see BPMInstallPackage command and BPMInstallOfflinePackage command.
6. To migrate running instances to the new snapshot, run the BPMMigrateInstances command
on the server. In the command, identify an old snapshot as the source and the new snapshot as the target. If
you exported a migration policy file for the source snapshot, add the path to that file as the
orphanTokenPolicyFile parameter. For information about the command, see BPMMigrateInstances command.Tip: You can also delete all orphaned tokens in
Process Inspector. However, with Process Inspector, you cannot choose to delete individual orphaned
tokens or move any tokens, for example

AdminTask.BPMMigrateInstances(â€™[-containerAcronym HSS -sourceContainerSnapshotAcronym V1 -targetContainerSnapshotAcronym V2 C:\logFiles\V1\_to\_SHSV856.xml]')
7. Optional: 
If necessary, set environment variables.
For example, the correct value for a particular environment (such as test or production)
might not be known during the design phase. In these situations, provide the value after installing
the snapshot in the new environment.
For information, see BPMSetEnvironmentVariable command or Configuring runtime environment variables.
8. Optional: 
If necessary, establish runtime teams.
For example, after you install a snapshot in a new environment (such as test or
production), you might need to add or remove users in the teams for that project. That is, users in
the test environment might not have been available in the development environment.
For information, see Configuring runtime teams.
9. Optional: If necessary,
control exposed processes and services. For example,
after you install a snapshot in a new environment (such as test or
production), you might need to disable a particular exposed process
or service within that process applicationFor information,
see Configuring exposed processes and services.

## What to do next

If you experience problems with your installation, check
the process-installer.log file. For more information
about what issues can occur, see Troubleshooting snapshot installations.
