# Roles and teams

When a role is mapped to a team, the team is automatically configured to access a team retrieval
service.

In Process Designer, there is no work required to
maintain a team that is mapped to a role because the team is read-only and its lifecycle is
dependent on the lifecycle of the role. For example, any update to (or deletion of) a role is
reflected in the corresponding team. You cannot add, rename, or delete a role-mapped team directly
in Process Designer. If you want to define or modify the
team, you must work with the corresponding role in the Roles tab of Case Builder. For information about managing roles in Case Builder, see Adding and selecting roles.

Regardless of whether a team is automatically or manually created in Process Designer, you must assign the team to a process as
described in the topic Assigning teams to a process.
