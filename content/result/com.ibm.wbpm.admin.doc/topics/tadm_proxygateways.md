# Administering services using proxy gateways

## Before you begin

Create a business space that contains the Proxy Gateway widget.

## About this task

- In the proxy gateway module, using IBMÂ® Integration
Designer.
- In the built-in configuration store in IBM Workflow
Server. When you deploy a proxy gateway module to
IBM Workflow
Server, any new proxy groups defined by
the module are automatically created. Note: When you uninstall a proxy gateway module, the proxy
groups defined by the module are not automatically deleted.

Proxy groups contain virtual services that you map to real service endpoints, using
the Proxy Gateway widget.

## Procedure

## Results

- Proxy Group: A group to which you can add virtual services that you map to
real service endpoints. You can use the icon after the Proxy Group heading to
sort the entries in ascending (^) or descending (v) order.
- Proxy Gateway: A module that can forward web service requests to an
endpoint defined in a proxy group. You can use the icon after the Proxy Gateway
heading to sort the entries in ascending (^) or descending (v) order.
