## Results

## What to do next

- Using a remote decision service

 To transition from having rules logic that is embedded in process applications to using external decision services that are provided by IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM), you can include a decision from a remote (or external) IBM ODM Rule Execution Server in your process application as an external service.
