<h1>Creating routes in a workflow</h1>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To create a route in a workflow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the Add connectors between steps icon.</li>
<li>Click the first step in the route.</li>
<li>Drag your mouse to the second step in the route.
A connector is added between the two steps. The arrowhead
on the connector indicates the direction that the route takes from
step to step and the order of the steps.</li>
<li>Optional: 
Select the connector and then specify
properties for the connector.
If the start step was configured
with responses, you can associate a response with the connector. The
response is displayed for the connector label in the canvas.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Splitting and joining an activity route</li>
</ul>

<p>Most workflows require branching at various points as the result of a response made by a participant. You use a split to start the branching and a join to bring the work back into a single path at the end of all the true routes.
- Route validation rules for a workflow</p>

<p>The steps and routing in a workflow must be valid before you can deploy the solution. When you are connecting steps, follow the route validation rules to ensure that your workflow is valid without route errors.

<p>Routes between the steps in a workflow definition specify how work progresses from one step to the next.</p>
