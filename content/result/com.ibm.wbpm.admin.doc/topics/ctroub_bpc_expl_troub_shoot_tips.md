# Process recovery troubleshooting tips

The Business Process Choreographer Explorer provides a user interface
for administrators to manage BPEL processes and human tasks.

You can use the Business Process Choreographer Explorer to check
the status of the Business Process Choreographer database (BPEDB).
If you are unable to retrieve database information through the Business
Process Choreographer Explorer, or if the Business Process Choreographer
is slow to return database information, it might be an indication
of a problem with the database.

Attempting to retrieve thousands of process instances or tasks is not wise if performance or
database problems are suspected. Selecting a view which does not retrieve considerable data, such as
My Process Templates, or limiting the amount of data retrieved for another view
would be better options.
