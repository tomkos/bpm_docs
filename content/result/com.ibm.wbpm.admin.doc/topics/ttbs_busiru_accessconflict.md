# Resolving access conflict errors

## Before you begin

## About this task

- Find the source of the business rule that is causing the error and check if your changes on the
local machine are still valid. Your change may no longer be required after the changes done by
another user.
- If you choose to continue working in the business process rules manager, you must reload those
business rule groups and rule schedules in error from the data source as your local changes of
business rule groups and rule schedules in error are no longer usable. Reload a business rule group
or rule schedule page, by clicking Reload in the Publish and Revert page of
the rule for which the error was reported. You can still use local changes in other business rule
groups and rule schedules that are not in error.
