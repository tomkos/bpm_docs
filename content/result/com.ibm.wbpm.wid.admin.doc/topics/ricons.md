clicking the module symbol.

The icons and symbols used in the
integration test client are primarily found in the following pages,
wizards, editors, and views:

- Events page
- Deployment Location wizard
- Configurations page
- New Test Configuration wizard
- New Test Module wizard
- New Monitor wizard
- New Emulator wizard
- New Programmatic Emulator wizard
