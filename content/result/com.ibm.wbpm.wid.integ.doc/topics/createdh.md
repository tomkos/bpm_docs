You can create your own data handlers in addition to using the data handlers that are included with the product.

- WTX data handler

The WTX data handler invokes the Websphere Transformation Extender to perform transformations from formats like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and many others to data object and vice versa. WebSphereÂ® Transformation Extender is a separately licensed product and is not included as part of IBM Integration Designer, IBM Business Automation Workflow or WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus. The product has to be installed with the WTX installer for these servers.
