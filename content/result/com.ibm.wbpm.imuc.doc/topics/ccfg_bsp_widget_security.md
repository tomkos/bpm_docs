## Widget role-based access

Some
widgets have role-based access for their artifacts that business users
created. In the Security Roles widget, you can assign users and groups
to system roles or module roles that determine the level of access
that members have for timetables in the Business Calendars widget.
For more information about the Security Roles widget, see Securing access to timetables in the Business Calendars widget.
