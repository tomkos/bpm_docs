# Task assignment in Process Portal: Frequently
asked questions

## Which tasks do I have access to?

- Tasks that are assigned directly to you.
- Your claimed tasks.
- Unclaimed tasks that are assigned to teams that you belong to.
- Tasks for which you are an expert.

## Who can I reassign my task to?

If you claim
a task by mistake, you can reassign the task back to your team or
you can reassign it to another team member. To reassign the task,
in the Work dashboard, click the task icon, then
select Modify Task. In the dialog box, select Back
to Team.

If you do not see any users when you are
reassigning tasks, contact your system administrator. There could
be too many users in the group that are eligible for the task.

## When I enter a name, I get too many users back. How
do I find the exact person that I am looking for?

## Why is the Back to team choice
not available for my task?

This behavior occurs when the
task was assigned only to you and not to one of the teams that you
belong to. You can, however, assign the task to another user in the Modify
Task dialog box.

## I received an email notification of a task assignment.
When I clicked the link, I got a Server not found error.
What should I do?
