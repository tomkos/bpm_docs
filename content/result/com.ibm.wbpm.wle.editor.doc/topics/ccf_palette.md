|        | Client-Side Script               | Use a client-side script when you want to add JavaScript code to run on the web browser in the client-side human service context, for parsing variables, and running programmatic commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|        | Service                          | Use a service to call another service from within a client-side human service. The called service adds an activity to the diagram, which calls another service that you can specify. The called service cannot be another client-side human service or a heritage human service (deprecated). See Calling another service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|        | Nested Client-Side Human Service | Use a nested client-side human service when you want to reuse a set of common steps in one or more other client-side human services. You can nest a reusable service in a root service or in another nested service. See Reusing client-side human services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|        | Event Handler                    | Use an event handler to add a subflow that is triggered by one of the following types of events. By default, the subflow is triggered by an error event. Error Event The subflow is triggered by an error event. Use an error event handler to add global error handling to a client-side human service. Data Change Event The subflow is triggered by a data change on the server. Use a data change event handler to control the refresh behavior of an instance details or task UI. A client-side human service can have only one data change event handler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|        | Exclusive Gateway                | Use an exclusive gateway to model a point in the execution flow where only one of several paths can be followed, depending on a condition. See Implementing exclusive gateways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|        | Intermediate Event               | Use an intermediate event to add a stay-on-page event, a postpone event, or an error boundary event to the client-side human service diagram. You can specify the event type in the Implementation properties of the intermediate event. The default implementation uses the stay-on-page event.  Stay-On-Page Event Use a stay-on-page event to loop the diagram back to the previous running coach without drawing a connection to it. The stay-on-page event returns the control back to the coach, so that any variable updates made since the boundary event for the coach are refreshed on the same user interface page.  Postpone Event Use a postpone event to postpone work on a specified task for later completion. The postpone event halts the execution of the task and keeps the task in a suspended state until it can be resumed at a later moment. This event can be used only with client-side human services that implement tasks in a process. See Enabling work to be postponed and resumed at run time.  Error Boundary Event  Shortcut key: B Use an error boundary event to catch errors and receive error data from the service to which it is attached. In the diagram, you can attach an error boundary event to a called service node or to a nested client-side human service node. See Handling errors in client-side human services. |
|        | End Event                        | Use an end event to end the service execution. Each path in a service requires its own end event.   End Event Use an end event to complete the processing of the human service. An end event is automatically included each time you create a service. See Navigation options for after service completion.  Error End Event Use an error end event to throw an error and end the processing of the human service. To throw a specific error, you can set the error properties in the Implementation view of the error end event, by specifying the error code and mapping the error end event to a specified variable.

|        | Note                             | Use a note to provide additional textual information to a client-side human service diagram. You can add reminders, development notes, or information that is relevant to a specified step in the human service. The notes can be added to the canvas as stand-alone objects or can be connected to specified nodes in the diagram. See Adding notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
