# Configuring single sign-on for federated process environments

## About this task

- Configuring single sign-on (SSO) for federated environments by using LTPA keys

In single sign-on (SSO) environments, Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) keys are exchanged between Process Portal or Workplace, Process Federation Server, and each server in the federated environment. When users log in to one server, they can access all the other servers in the federated environment for which they are authorized without getting prompted again for their credentials.
- Configuring single sign-on (SSO) for federated environments by using the User Management Service

If Process Federation Server is federating Business Automation Workflow V18.0.0.1 (and later), you can use the User Management Service (UMS) to provide the convenience of single sign-on between Process Federation Server and these Business Automation Workflow environments.
- Configuring single sign-on for federated environments by using third-party authentication products

You can use third-party authentication products to enable single sign-on (SSO).
