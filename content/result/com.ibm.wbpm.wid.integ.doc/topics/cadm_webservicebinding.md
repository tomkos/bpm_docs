# Web service bindings

- Web service bindings overview

A web service import binding allows you to call an external web service from your Service Component Architecture (SCA) components. A web service export binding allows you to expose your SCA components to clients as web services.
- SOAP header propagation

When handling SOAP messages, you might need to access information from certain SOAP headers in messages that are received, ensure that messages with SOAP headers are sent with specific values, or allow SOAP headers to pass across a module.
- Transport header propagation

When handling SOAP messages, you might need to access information from certain transport headers in messages that are received, ensure that messages with transport headers are sent with specific values, or allow transport headers to pass across a module.
- Working with web service (JAX-WS) bindings

When you use web service (JAX-WS) bindings with your applications, you can add a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) quality of service (QOS) to the binding. You must first use the administrative console to import the policy set. You can also use the administrative console to make sure that the server is properly configured for use with the web service (JAX-WS) binding.
- Attachments in SOAP messages

You can send and receive SOAP messages that include binary data (such as PDF files or JPEG images) as attachments. Attachments can be referenced (that is, represented explicitly as message parts in the service interface) or unreferenced (in which arbitrary numbers and types of attachments can be included).
- Use of WSDL document style binding with multipart messages

The Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) organization has defined a set of rules regarding how web services should be described by way of a WSDL and how the corresponding SOAP messages should be formed, in order to ensure interoperability.
