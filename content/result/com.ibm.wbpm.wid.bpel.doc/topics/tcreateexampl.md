# Modelling business calendars using examples

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Click Add Interval or Add Exception. A list of examples are displayed.
2. Select the example to use to create your new business calendar.
3. From here you can edit the example to meet your own requirements.
For example, instead of a working day of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., you may
have the requirement of a 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. workday. To make this
change, edit the First occurrence fields.
4. Set the repetition to indicate when and how often you would
like the business calendar to run. You can select the time interval
preferences from the Schedule, First occurrence, Repeat daily, and
Repeat forever options.
5. To add the unavailability period, click Add
Exception . For example, to schedule an unavailability
period for a daily lunch hour, select Lunch 12 to 1, every
day from the list of examples.
6. In the Details for the Selected Exception, edit the First occurrence and repetitions
fields as needed. You should now see the exception listed in the calendar
details.
7. Save the business calendar. Note that it is now available
in the business integration view under the Business Logic container.

## What to do next

To see a schedule representation of the business calendar, click Schedule
Overview. The schedule will open in the Properties tab. From here you can view the
schedule on a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis. If you see a blank schedule or a Flash
information graphic, it is because the schedule won't display if Flash isn't installed. Flash is end
of life. For more information, see the Adobe Flash Player EOL General Information Page.
