# Hiring Sample Overview

## The story: Standard HR Open New Position process

The Hiring Sample process application includes a process that is named Standard HR Open New
Position, which captures the steps and decision points for submitting and processing a position
request to fill a position. The process diagram is shown in the following figure:

In the process diagram, the following workflows are modeled:

- The hiring manager determines the position requirements and prepares a position request for
submission to the Human Resources (HR) department.
- A hiring manager submits a position request either to fill a new position or to replace a
departing employee in an existing position.
- If the position request is to fill a new position, the position request is routed to the General
Manager (GM) for approval. The GM evaluates the position request and either approves it or rejects
it.
- If the GM approves the position request, it is routed to HR, which can then search for job
candidates.
- If the GM rejects the position request, the hiring manager is notified and the position request
is terminated.
- If the position request is to fill an existing position, the position request is routed directly
from the hiring manager to HR, which can then search for job candidates.
