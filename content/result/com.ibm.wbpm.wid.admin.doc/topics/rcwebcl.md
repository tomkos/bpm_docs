# Integration test client

The integration test client is shown in the following
figure:

The test client supports
component debugging by automatically performing the following tasks:

- Deploying your module and components to the server
- Starting the server in Debug mode
- Creating a component instance that you can pass values and debug

You can open multiple windows of the test client in the workbench
and then use each test client window to create a different instance
of the same component or another component, which you can simultaneously
debug in the integration debugger.

The integration debugger
documentation provides sufficient information about the integration
test client to enable you to use it with the integration debugger.
However, if you want to learn more about the integration test client,
see the integration test client topic "Testing authentication using the integration test client."
