# Assuring Quality of Service

- Setting qualifiers and transactions

Qualifiers propagate transactions and control the quality and timing of message delivery.
The assembly editor generates quality of service qualifiers for interfaces, references, and
implementations in the assembly editor. The editor also provides ways for you to examine and change
the settings.
- Quality of service qualifier reference

Qualifiers are specifications that define a set of communication characteristics required
by an application for transmission priority, level of route reliability, transaction management, and
security level. You can specify quality of service qualifiers in the assembly editor. These
qualifiers define how much management must be provided for a component at run time.
