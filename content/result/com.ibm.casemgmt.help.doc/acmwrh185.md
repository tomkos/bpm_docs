# Configuring the Form widget to use a form attachment (deprecated)

## About this task

## Procedure

To configure the Form widget to use a form attachment:

1. In Case Builder,
open the page that contains the Form widget in Page Designer and click
the Edit Settings icon on the Form widget.
2. Select Form attachment (step scenarios only) from
the Open the form by using list.
3. In the Folder field, enter the name
of the folder in which to save the form data document. 
The
folder must be a subfolder of the case folder. If the subfolder does
not exist, you can create one by entering a new name. If you do not
enter a subfolder name, the form data document is saved directly in
the case folder.
