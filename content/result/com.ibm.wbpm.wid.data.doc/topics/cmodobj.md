|                | Namespace      | String  | Namespace of the role. The Namespace is mandatory and has to be a valid URI representation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                | isManaged      | Boolean | The isManaged flag is only set for an identity relationship. There is only one role to be set as the managed role. This flag indicates that the role is representing a generic data type which is managed by the Relationship Runtime Service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Role Object    | roleObjectType | QName   | The roleObjectType specifies the reference to the data type which is used for the role. For example, for a simple XSD data type this could be "xs:string".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                | Displayname    | String  | Displayname of the role object. The Displayname can be set in the relationship editor for further use in the relationship service or relationship manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Key Attribute  | Path           | String  | Path to the attribute within the Data Type. Depending on the type of the relationship and the function of the role of the data type, the path can be set to different levels of depth. In lookup relationships the level can be infinite. This means that if you have a customer data type you can specify the following key attribute path: "CompanyAddress/PostalAddress/ZipCode". In non-lookup relationships, only two levels are allowed to be specified as the key attribute path, for example "Address/ZipCode". It is recommended to use only first level key attribute paths like "Id". |
|                | Displayname    | String  | Displayname of the key attribute. The Displayname can be set in the relationship editor for further use in the relationship service or relationship manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Property       | Name           | String  | Name of the property. The name of the property is mandatory and has to be unique for the object where this user defined property is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|                | propertyType   | QName   | The propertyType specifies the reference to the data type which is used for the user defined property. This attribute is mandatory. There are only simple XSD types allowed to be used, for example, "xs:string".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|                | value          | String  | The default value of the user defined property. The type of content for the value is defined by the propertyType. There is a simple type check if the given value makes sense as a value for the given type of the user defined property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
