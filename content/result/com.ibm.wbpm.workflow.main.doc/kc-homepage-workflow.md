Workflow on containers

Workflow on containers.
- Traditional: Installing, configuring, and migrating IBM Business Automation Workflow

 Traditional: 
IBM Business Automation Workflow can be installed and
configured for multiple topologies. You can install all components on a single cluster or you can
distribute the components across multiple clusters. To achieve a highly available environment with
failover support, you can install IBM Business Automation Workflow into a clustered
environment that uses the clustering mechanism of WebSphere® Application
Server.
- Managing projects

A project is a set of artifacts that share the same lifecycle and are grouped to
solve a particular business problem. You use projects to build, manage, share, and organize these
assets. For example, you create, develop, and test your process
application and then install it on the server so
that people can use it to do their work.
- Business process management

IBM Business Automation
Workflow provides a comprehensive
business process management platform. It provides a robust set of tools to author, test, and deploy
business processes, as well as full visibility and insight to managing those business processes.
- Case management

IBM Business Automation
Workflow simplifies the job of designing
and building a case management system and provides a graphical user interface for case workers to
easily manage cases. You can design a case management solution that is based on closely related
cases and then deploy that solution into a production environment. Case workers can then complete
work items associated with cases.
- Managing work

Manage and work on your tasks, participate in workflows and cases to complete work and,
with the associated permission, use dashboards to manage and evaluate the workload and performance
of your teams.
