# Creating transforms using the graph view

## About this task

- From the source, click and grab the wire handle  and connect it to the target. The connection going to the
left side of the transform node is the source, and the one
coming out from the right side of the transform node is the target.
- Right-click the field or business object to be used in the transform
and select Create Transform ->type of transform from
the menu. You can either create a Custom Callout, Custom Assign, or
Assign transform, depending on the type of field or business object
selected.
- Right-click the field or business object to be the source of a
transform, and select Add Connection. This
will initiate a connection, and then you can select the target of
the connection by clicking on it. A new transform will be created
between the objects.Note: Using this method will allow the use of
the editors scroll bars which is useful when dealing with large business
object maps that require scrolling to complete the transform creation.
- Use the Ctrl key to select input(s) and
output(s) and click Create transform  on the
toolbar.
