# Tracking groups of process variables

## About this task

- You can group similar data together for analysis. For example,
you can track employee data, account data, or shipment status information
in independent tracking groups.
- You can track process variables across multiple processes and
process applications. For example, if your organization includes several
locations and each location has a similar, but unique, onboarding
process for new employees, you can create a tracking group to capture
the business data for all of these processes.
- Tracking points for a timing interval can span multiple processes.
For example, if you want to measure the duration between steps that
start in one process and end in a nested process, you can include
the start tracking point in the main process and the end tracking
point in the nested process.

- Creating a tracking group

Create and use a tracking group to track process variables across multiple processes and process applications, or to store tracking points for a timing interval. Use tracking groups when you want to explicitly control your tracked data and tracking points for more advanced custom reports.
- Associating process variables to a tracking group

To track process variables for performance monitoring, you can associate them to a tracking group.
