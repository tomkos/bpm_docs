<h1>History view for the Case Information</h1>

<p>widget</p>

<p>In the History view, a case worker can use
preset filter views to easily find relevant case events. A case worker
can also select whether detailed information or summary information
is to be displayed for each case.  The amount of information that
is displayed depends upon the type of event. Limited information is
displayed for events that are not supported by IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow.</p>

<p>For each event, the History view
includes the type, title, description, time stamp, and user name.</p>

<p>You can edit the settings for the Case Information widget to specify
the number of events that can be displayed on a page in the History view.</p>
