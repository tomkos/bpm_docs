# Migrating applications using previous adapter levels

A utility can migrate your applications using a previous adapter level to the current level. It
is a two-step process that replaces the previous version of the RAR file in a module with the
current version and then migrates the business data in the module itself. Read the "Migrating to
version 7.5.0.3" information. You will find this section in the information for each adapter; it is
nested beneath the "Planning for adapter implementation" section.

The WebSphere InterChange Migration wizard and the WebSphere Business Integration Server
Foundation Migration wizard have been removed from IBMÂ® Integration
Designer V8.5.7. Step 2 of "Migrating to version
7.5.0.3" no longer applies. All the information in "Migrating WebSphere Business Integration
applications" no longer applies.
