# Manage Roles

Each solution has one or more roles that are associated with it. The Manage Roles view helps you
to add users and groups to a role, which determines the tasks that you can perform and the resources
that you can access.

1. Click the Manage Roles button.
2. Select a role for which you want to change the membership and click Add Users and
groups.Note: If you are looking for a role that is not listed, ask your business analyst
whether a new role can be added.
3. Search a selected domain for users or groups.
4. Select users and groups to move them to the role membership.Note: If you do not see expected
users or groups, contact your IT administrator to ask whether you are using the correct domain. The
IT administrator might need to add users and groups to the system.
5. Click OK in both windows to save your changes.
