<h1>Properties widget events</h1>

<p>For example, the Properties widget handles an incoming
event to display the properties for a case type so that the user can
create a case of that type.</p>

<ul>
<li>Properties widget outgoing events</li>

<p>The Properties widget provides outgoing events that are broadcast and wired to the other widgets on the page. The data that is included in the payload of a broadcast event is processed by any widget that has a corresponding handled event. The data that is included in the payload of a wired event is processed by the handled event in the target widget to which the published widget is wired.
