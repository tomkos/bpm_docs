# Configuration for IMS programs

The following MQIIH header fields will need to be configured
if you want to invoke an IMS program.

| Field                                  | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Format                                 | The format field contains the MQ format name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ReplyTo format                         | The ReplyTo format field contains the format name of the reply message that is sent in response to the current message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Flags                                  | The flags field determines the expiry time and can set the format of the response message to none. Pass expiration sets the expiry option to unlimited; otherwise, the expiry is set to the same expiry options as the request message. ReplyTo format NONE sets the MQIIH.Format field of the reply to MQFMT\_NONE.                                                 |
| Coded Character Set Identifier (CCSID) | A Coded Character Set Identifier (CCSID) contains the information for working with characters as they are being processed, including the code page or code pages to be used.  It includes schemes on how to handle single byte and double byte characters with bidirectional languages.  The CCSID value for UTF-8 is 1208.  See Globalize your On Demand Business. |
| Integer encoding                       | The significance of the byte order sequence for integer values.  Reversed (little endian) has the numeric significance increasing, while Normal (big endian) has the most significant byte first.  Windows systems are Reversed, while pSeries and zSeries are Normal.                                                                                              |
| Decimal encoding                       | The significance of the byte order sequence for packed decimal values.  Reversed (little endian) has the numeric significance increasing, while Normal (big endian) has the most significant byte first.  Windows systems are Reversed, while pSeries and zSeries are Normal.                                                                                       |
| Float encoding                         | The format and significance of the byte order sequence for floating point values.  The formats are IEEE and S390.   With IEEE you can specify Reversed (little endian) or Normal (big endian).  S390 format is always Normal (big endian).   Windows systems are IEEE Reversed and pSeries are IEEE Normal.                                                         |
