# Enabling tool capabilities

Enable capabilities to limit
the functions that are available to the user. You can enable and disable
tool capabilities in several ways.

## About this task

IBMÂ® Integration
Designer supports a range of
servers and runtime deployment environments. Tools are grouped into predefined categories called
capabilities according to the target runtime that they support. You use capabilities to
filter your development environment, so that you see only the tools that you need. In order to
access a tool, its capability must be enabled.
