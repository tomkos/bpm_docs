# Moving extended data elements inside or outside of other extended
data elements

In the event definition editor, you can move extended data
elements inside or outside of other extended data elements without
needing to directly modify the underlying source code. When you move
an extended data element inside of another extended data element,
the extended data element that you are moving becomes a child of the
extended data element that you are moving it into. When you move an
extended data element outside of another extended data element,
the extended data element that you are moving becomes a peer of the
extended data element that you are moving it out of.
