# Test suite editor

The test suite editor is shown in the following figure:

- 1 Overview page
- 2 Test Cases page
- 3 Configurations page

Additionally, there is a Test Data Table view that is not shown
in the figure.

Almost all of the tasks that you can perform in the test
suite editor are either initiated or performed in these three pages and one
view, as described in the following topics:

- Overview page

In the Overview page, you can quickly view the essential information for the test suite that is open in the test suite editor.
- Test Cases page

In the Test Cases page of the test suite editor, you can perform numerous activities to prepare your test suite and test cases for testing, such as selecting an operation invocation for which you want to specify values in the test data table.
- Test Data Table view

At the bottom of the test suite editor, a Test Data Table view is provided that enables you to import Java extension classes or packages and specify, view, and edit values for operations.
- Configurations page of the test suite editor

In the Configurations page of the test suite editor, you can edit the default test configuration. This enables you to add modules to your test configuration, or add emulators and monitors to your test configuration modules, to more precisely control your tests.
