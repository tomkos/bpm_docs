<h1>Adding a workgroup to an activity</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>Before you add a step that must be completed by members of a specific workgroup, you must have a
step for a case worker to add users to the workgroup. You can create a separate step or you can add
the action to edit the workgroup to the Launch step for the activity. The activity must be a
discretionary activity or else you cannot edit the Launch step. You can also use IBM®
FileNet® Process Designer instead of Step Designer to add a workgroup to a
step.</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To add a workgroup to an activity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click Manage Workgroups, then click Add
Workgroup.</li>
<li>Provide a prompt for this workgroup.
A prompt
is displayed in Case Client to
remind the case worker to add members to the workgroup.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
<li>Click Close.</li>
<li>Identify the step in your process that must be assigned
to a workgroup.
6 Add the step for the workgroup to complete:
<ol>
<li>Add a workgroup lane for the new step.
If
there is more than one workgroup defined, change the workgroup in
the Workgroup Property section.</li>
<li>Add a step to the lane.</li>
<li>In the Step Properties section, set the properties as
needed for this step.</li>
<li>Click OK. Then, click Close.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Add a connector from the LaunchStep or
the other step where the workgroup members are assigned to the step
that the workgroup must complete.</li>
<li>Apply your changes and validate the workflow.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Adding a step to assign workgroup members</li>
</ul>

<p>If you include a workgroup in a task, create a step for the case worker to assign members to the workgroup.
