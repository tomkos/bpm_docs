# Deploy the module

## About this task

Testing begins as soon as the module is deployed because
the application has been started implicitly as it is in inbound processing
mode.

To deploy the module to the server:

## Procedure

1. Click Servers to open the Server view.
2. Right-click IBMÂ® Workflow
Server and
select Start from the context menu.
3. Once the server is in the Started state,
right-click IBM Workflow
Server.
From the context menu, select Add and Remove.
Select SeparateCustomersApp from Available
projects. Click Add. Click Finish.
4. Testing the module at run time begins at this point since,
as discussed previously, the application is in inbound processing
mode. See Test the module for the
output expected.
