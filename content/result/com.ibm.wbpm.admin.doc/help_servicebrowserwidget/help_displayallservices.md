# Listing services defined in WSRR

## Before you begin

1. Ensure that Process Server has a definition for the WSRR that you want to use.
2. Load the WSDL file that defines your service into WSRR.
3. Create a business space that contains the administration widgets you need, including the
Service Browser widget.

## About this task

You can list the services that are defined in an instance of WSRR. In addition, you can list the
endpoints and operations that are defined for the services.

## Procedure

1. Log in to your business space and navigate to the space that you created for administering
services.
2. From the Service Browser widget, check that the correct WSRR definition is
displayed. If the correct WSRR definition is not displayed, select the correct WSRR definition. 
If your application server has definitions for more than one instance of WSRR, you can display
the services that are defined on each WSRR.

## Results

When you change the WSRR definition, the list of services is refreshed.
