# Managing access to the Workflow Center repository

The best way to manage access to Workflow Center and its repository is
by using Business Automation Workflow
tw\_admins (administrative access) and tw\_authors
(non-administrative access) groups whose members have access to the repository by default.

Before you complete any of the following tasks, start IBMÂ® Process
Designer and open Workflow Center, or use a browser to
open Workflow Center.

- Granting access to the Workflow Center repository

Users in the tw\_authors group have access to the Workflow Center repository. You can add users and groups to the tw\_authors group  to grant them access to Process Designer and the Workflow Center repository so that they can import or create new process applications and toolkits.
- Granting administrative access to the Workflow Center repository

Users in the tw\_admins group have administrative access to the Workflow Center repository and can grant administrative access to other users.
- Managing access to workflow projects

You can provide users and groups with permission to access individual workflow projects, specifically process applications, toolkits, and case templates.
- Setting permissions to import applications to the Workflow Center repository

If you want to import process applications and toolkits to IBM Workflow Center, you must modify permission settings for the temporary directory that your operating system uses.
