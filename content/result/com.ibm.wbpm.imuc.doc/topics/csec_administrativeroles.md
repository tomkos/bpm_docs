# Administrative
security roles

There are eight roles provided as part of the administrative
console.
These roles grant permission to ranges of functionality on the administrative
console. When administrative security is enabled, a user must be mapped
to one of these roles in order to access the administrative console.

The first user to log in to the server after installation is added
to the administrator role.
