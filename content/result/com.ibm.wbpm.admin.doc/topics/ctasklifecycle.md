# Lifecycle of human tasks

- State transition diagrams for to-do tasks

To-do tasks are created automatically by a client application or calling component. They support people when they perform work as part of a BPEL process (inline tasks), or implement a web service that is publicly available (stand-alone task). During the lifecycle of a to-do task, certain interactions are possible only in certain task states, and these interactions, in turn, influence the state of the task.
- State transition diagrams for collaboration tasks

Collaboration tasks support people when they perform work for other people. During the lifecycle of a collaboration task, certain interactions are possible only in certain task states, and these interactions, in turn, influence the state of the task.
- State transition diagrams for invocation tasks

Invocation tasks support people when they invoke services. During the lifecycle of an invocation task, certain interactions are possible only in certain task states, and these interactions, in turn, influence the state of the task.
- State transition diagrams for administration tasks

Administration tasks support people in administering BPEL processes and their activities. During the lifecycle of an administration task, certain interactions are possible only in certain task states, and these interactions, in turn, influence the state of the task.
- How task states in Business Process Choreographer relate to the task status in Business Space

Business Process Choreographer includes the concept of a task state, which is defined as a stage in the lifecycle  of a task. For example, a task can be in the inactive or running state. The same concept in the Human Task Management widgets in Business Space powered by WebSphereÂ® is called the task status. In addition, the names and number of the individual task states differ in Business Process Choreographer and in Business Space.
