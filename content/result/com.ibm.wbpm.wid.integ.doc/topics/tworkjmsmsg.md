# Creating applications with JMS bindings

- Creating a JMS import to communicate with a JMS client

You might want to connect your service-oriented architecture (SOA) application to an existing JMS client. In this task, we will take you step by step through the steps necessary to do this.
- Creating a JMS export to communicate with a JMS client

There might be an existing JMS client that you want to communicate to with your service-oriented architecture (SOA) application.  In this task, we will take you step by step through the steps necessary to do this.
- Creating a JMS client to receive messages from a JMS import

Previously, the focus has been to show how to create SCA imports and exports to communicate with a JMS client. This section shows the reverse; that is, if you have an SCA import with an interface and a business object, this section shows the JMS client code you would need to create to communicate with them.
- Creating an import from an export using a JMS binding

Once you have created an export, another module may want to use it. This section shows you how to quickly create an import in one module from an export in another using a JMS binding.
- Creating a user-defined JMS data binding

A user-defined JMS data binding is necessary when the JMS client is expecting a Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) and the SCA application is expecting business objects.
