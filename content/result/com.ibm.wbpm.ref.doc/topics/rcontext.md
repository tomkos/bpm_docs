| context.binding             | Provides access to the data object that is bound to the current view. To access the data, use the following call:this.context.binding.get("value")Where value is a special property name that returns the bound data object.For example, if a view is bound to local.phoneBook.title, the view can get the title by using the following code:if (!! this.context.binding){ 	var title = this.context.binding.get("value") }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| context.element             | Contains the root DOM element of the view. The view must not delete this DOM element. Views that are defined in the layout are children of this root element. Generally, the view uses this root DOM element to locate its own content.Note: Multiple instances of the same view can be on the same HTML page. Use this root DOM element to scope your search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| context.bpm.system.settings | Provides access to the following properties related to timer-based refreshing for views:  TimerCoachViewEnabled (Boolean). This setting specifies the active or inactive status of the timer coach control used on the default instance details user interface to trigger automatic refreshes. By default, this setting is true, which means the timer control is active. TimerCoachViewRefreshInterval (Integer). This setting specifies the frequency of refresh requests triggered by the timer coach control. The value is defined in seconds. The default value is-1, indicating that the value used in the coach control configuration is to be used. Administrators can override the settings specified in the models using this property.

## Functions

## Example: Get and use a domNode

Many
functions of the context object take a document node (domNode)
as an argument. The following code example shows how to get a domNode and
use it in a function.

```
1Â  var subview = this.context.getSubview("subviewID", "true")[5];
Â 2Â  var subviewDomNode = subview.context.element;
Â 3Â  this.context.deleteView(subviewDomNode);
```

- 1Â  The parameter subviewID is
the control ID of the subview and corresponds to the value for the
property data-viewid of the <div></<div> tag
of the subview instance. The function getSubview(subViewID) returns
an array of subviews. In this example, the intent is to get the sixth
element in the index of arrays. The parameter true ensures
that the objects of the array are returned in the same order as the
DOM.
- 2Â  Get the domNode of
the subview element that is returned in step 1.
- 3Â  Delete the subview by using the domNode that
step 2 returns.

## Example: Get a div ID

To
get the div ID of an element, use the syntax this.context.element.id

To
get the ID of a subview, first get the domNode of
the subview and then use .id.

```
1Â  var subview = this.context.getSubview("subviewID", "true")[5];
Â 2Â  var subviewDomNode = subview.context.element;
Â 3Â  var subViewDomId = subviewDomNode.id; // This gives you the ID of the subview
```

- 1Â  The parameter subviewID is
the control ID of the subview and corresponds to the value for the
property data-viewid of the <div></<div> tag
of the subview instance. The function getSubview(subViewID) returns
an array of subviews. In our example, we want the sixth element in
the index of arrays. The parameter true ensures
that the objects of the array are returned in the same order as the
DOM.
- 2Â  Get the domNode of
the subview element that is returned in step 1.
- 3Â  Get the ID of the subview.
