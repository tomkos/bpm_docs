# Showing variable type logical structures in the integration
debugger

## About this task

## Procedure

1. In the Debug view, ensure that the correct stack frame
is selected for the variable types whose implementation details you
want to show.
2. In the Variables view, click the Show Logical
Structure icon . The content in the Variables
view is expanded to include the full implementation details.
3. If you later want to show the logical structure for the
variable types, click the Show Logical Structure icon
again. This filters out the implementation details and reduces the
content displayed in the Variables view to just variables, business
object fields (or variable parts), and values.
