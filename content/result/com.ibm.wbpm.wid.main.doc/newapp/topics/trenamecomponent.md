# Renaming components

If you want to rename a component in the assembly editor,
you can choose between simply renaming the component without renaming
its implementation or renaming both the component and its implementation.
You might want to rename components to keep the names of the component
and implementation in synchronization.

## Procedure

To rename a component, complete the following steps:

1 In the assembly editor, complete one of the following steps:
    - Right-click the component that you want to rename and click Refactor > Rename. The Rename Component window opens.
    - Open the Properties view for the component and click the Description tab, then move the cursor to the Name field and press Ctrl+Shift+R. The Rename Component window opens.
2 Select one of the following options:

- If you only want to rename the selected component without
also renaming the associated implementation, select Rename
the component only.
- If you want to rename both the selected component and its
associated implementation, select Rename the component
implementation, which also renames the component.
3. To continue refactoring and renaming the component in the
same manner as any other artifact, click OK.
