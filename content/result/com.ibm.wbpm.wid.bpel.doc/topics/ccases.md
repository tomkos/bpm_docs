# BPEL processes and IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow cases

- The evaluation of a job application
- The verdict of a traffic violation
- The outcome of a tax assessment
- A patient coming to a hospital for a routine procedure
- The ruling on an insurance claim.

- Expedite the process - a judge may dismiss a case without going
to trial.
- Trigger subprocesses - a doctor may order a blood test because
a patient is not responding in an expected fashion.
- Repeat a number of activities if the initial results were not
satisfactory - a job applicant may be called in for a 2nd interview
if an additional manager wants a chance to talk to the applicant.
- Take an alternative path through the main flow of activities -
an insurance adjustor may feel the need to visit a claimant to check
on certain details.

The collaboration scope activity is the preferred tool for
handling cases.
