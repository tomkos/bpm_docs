# Managing work

- Before 23.0.1, Workplace was supported only in
Business Automation Workflow container
environments. In traditional environments,  Process Portal was the only work
portal available for you to work on tasks and process instances. To complete non-process work, you
relied to other tools, such as Case Client for case work.
- Starting with 23.0.1, Workplace is also supported in
traditional  Business Automation Workflow environments, which means that you can decide which work portal to use for your work. You can
either step up and improve the way you do your work by choosing to use Workplace, or you can continue
using Process Portal as you
did before 23.0.1. Note: Keep in mind that Process Portal might be deprecated in
a future release to make the move from the old to the newer work portal easier.

If you've been waiting to try out the modern and easily customizable Workplace to create your own
custom-built work portal without having to move to a container environment, you can start using
Workplace for your daily
work.

Workplace is
available in both traditional and container Business Automation Workflow environments, which
makes it the common work portal for different platforms. Getting used to completing work easily and
more efficiently in Workplace can ease your
transition from traditional to containers.
