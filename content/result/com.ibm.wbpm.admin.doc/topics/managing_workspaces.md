# Managing branches

- Enabling branches

A branch is an optional subdivision in a process applications based on team tasks or process application versions. If additional branches are necessary for a process application, you can enable them at any time.
- Creating branches

When you create a project, IBM Business Automation Workflow creates a single default branch named Main. After branches are enabled for a project, you can create additional branches.
- Editing branches

You can change the name of a branch and the description of the branch.
- Setting the default branch

When you create a project, IBM Business Automation Workflow creates a single default branch named Main. If you create additional branches, you can configure one of the new branches as the default branch.
- Copying changed assets from one branch to another

After you work in isolation on separate features that are related to a project, creating or updating assets, you need to copy those changes from a snapshot to the tip of a branch, usually the main branch.
- Archiving branches

If a branch is no longer used, you can archive it. The option for that branch will no longer appear in the Branches drop-down menu in the classic Workflow Center for the project. If only two branches exist for a project and you archive one of them, the Branches drop-down menu no longer displays. You must restore an archived branch before you can open it in IBM Process Designer.
- Deleting branches

If a branch is no longer used, you can delete it. The option for that branch no longer appears in the Branches tab in the Workflow Center for the project. Deleting unused branches can improve the performance of the process application.
