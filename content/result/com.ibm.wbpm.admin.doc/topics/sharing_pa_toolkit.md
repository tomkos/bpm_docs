# Traditional: Registering Process Centers and sharing toolkit
(deprecated)

You can share toolkits with other users, even if those users are working in a different Process Center. You no longer
need to first export the toolkits from one Process Center and then import
them into another Process Center.

1. An administrator enables both Process Centers for
sharing.
2. An administrator registers the Process Center that accesses
the shared toolkit.
3. The author of the toolkit that will be shared selects a snapshot of that toolkit and releases
it.
4. The author of the toolkit that will be shared selects that toolkit and shares it with other
Process Centers,
enabling that toolkit to be shared with any Process Center that is
registered to the sharing Process Center.Restriction: The shared toolkit is downloaded to the subscribing Process Center as a read-only
copy. The subscriber cannot modify or share the subscribed toolkit.

After a toolkit is shared, events are synchronized and snapshots are released automatically once
every 24 hours. The sharing Process Center is notified when
a shared toolkit is being used on a registered Process Center. The subscribing
Process Center is
notified of new released snapshots as well as the state of the shared toolkits.
