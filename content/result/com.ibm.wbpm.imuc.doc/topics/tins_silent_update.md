# Installing fix packs for IBM Integration
Designer silently

## Procedure

To update IBM Integration
Designer silently,
complete the following steps:

1. Read and accept the license terms before
updating. Adding -acceptLicense to the command line
means that you accept all licenses.
2 Start your command prompt by right-clicking and selecting Run asadministrator : extract\_directory \disk1\IM\_win64\tools\imcl install com.ibm.integration.designer.v85 -acceptLicense -installationDirectory location -repositories repository -showVerboseProgress -log logName .log where

```
extract\_directory\disk1\IM\_win64\tools\imcl install com.ibm.integration.designer.v85
    -acceptLicense -installationDirectory location -repositories repository 
    -showVerboseProgress -log logName.log
```

    - location is the path to the directory where you want to update the
products.
    - repository is the path to the repository where you have extracted the fix
pack files. For more than one repository, separate the repository locations with commas.
    - logName is the name of the log file to record messages and results.
3 If you also want to update the test environment, run the same command again with the correctinstallation directory and the required package IDs: extract\_directory \disk1\IM\_win64\tools\imcl install list\_of\_package\_IDs -acceptLicense -installationDirectory test\_location -repositories repository -showVerboseProgress -log logName .log where

```
extract\_directory\disk1\IM\_win64\tools\imcl install list\_of\_package\_IDs -acceptLicense 
    -installationDirectory test\_location -repositories repository -showVerboseProgress 
    -log logName.log
```

- list\_of\_package\_IDs is a list of the IDs for the products you want to update,
separated by spaces.
