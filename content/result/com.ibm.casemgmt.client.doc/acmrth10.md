# Adding to favorites and syncing folders and documents

## About this task

The favorites and sync features are available only if they are configured by your system
administrator.

You can sync documents, folders, and cases in the form of folders. Syncing your favorite files
saves time because you do not need to manually check out, check in, and download items that you work
with regularly. You can also ensure that other users of those documents receive the changed content.
You can also view the documents or files offline after they are synced.

## Procedure

To create favorites and enable sync:

1. Select the document, folder, or case folder that you want to add to favorites.
2. Select the action to add the selection to favorites.
3. Optional: 
Click Sync this item.

## What to do next

Check the Favorites or Home view to see the files and
folders that you added on your device or workstation. To learn more about how to use sync most
