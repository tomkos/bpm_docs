# Best Practice: When to not use the BPEL extensions

When you first create a BPEL process, you are given the opportunity
to disable the extensions. In order to help you with this decision,
here are some cases when you would NOT want to have the extension
enabled:

- When you are designing the process to be used or edited in another
set of tools.
- When you are planning on executing the process in a runtime environment
other than IBM Workflow
Server.
- When you want to exchange information with a business partner
who is not using the IBM Integration
Designer or IBM Workflow
Server set
of tools.
