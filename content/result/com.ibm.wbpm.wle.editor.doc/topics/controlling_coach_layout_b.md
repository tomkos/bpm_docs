# Setting the number of columns in a heritage coach (deprecated)

## Procedure

1. Open the service that contains the heritage coach that you want to change and then click the
Coaches tab.
2. In the design area, click the section that you want to
change.
3. Click the Section option in the properties and then click
the up and down arrows for the # of Columns option
