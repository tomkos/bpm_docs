| User Task               | Select this option if an activity is to be started or completed by a user (human performer). For example, if an activity requires that managers enter employee data, choose  User Task and select or create a client-side human service or a heritage human service (deprecated) to implement the task. You can also implement a user task by using an external service that has an external implementation.                                                                      | Building a client-side human serviceBuilding a heritage human service Creating an external implementation to implement an activity |
| Inline User Task        | Inline user tasks are extensions of user tasks. You do not need to attach a human service to an inline user task because a human service is already provided by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Working with inline user tasksConfiguring coach templates for inline user tasks                                                    |
| System Task             | Select this option if an activity is to be completed by an automated system or service. For example, if an activity requires integration with an external system, such as a database, choose System Task and select or create an Integration service to implement the task.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Service types                                                                                                                      |
| Decision Task           | Select this option when you want a decision or condition in a business rule to determine which process implementation is started. For example, if you want to implement an activity when a condition evaluates to true, choose Decision Task and select or create a decision service to implement the task.                                                                                                                                                                       | Service types                                                                                                                      |
| Script                  | Choose this option if you plan to create a script to implement an activity. A Script activity runs a Javaâ„¢ script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Using complex variables and lists in JavaScript                                                                                    |
| Subprocess              | Use this option to encapsulate logically related steps within a parent process. Steps in a subprocess can directly access business objects (variables) from the parent process. No data mapping is required. However, unlike a linked process, a subprocess can be accessed and instantiated only from the parent process, and it is not reusable by any other process or subprocess. Therefore, use a subprocess for those implementations that are limited to a single process. | Modeling subprocesses                                                                                                              |
| Linked Process          | You can implement an activity by using a linked process. Linked processes encapsulate logically related steps within a process while retaining the high-level view of the parent process. Linked processes differ from subprocesses because they can be accessed and instantiated from processes other than a single parent process.                                                                                                                                              | Working with linked processes                                                                                                      |
| Event Subprocess        | Use this specialized subprocess to model event-handling logic for a process or subprocess. It is triggered upon occurrence of a configured start event, and it is not connected to other steps through a sequence flow. It has access to the business objects (variables) of its parent process, and can encapsulate steps that use those variables. When triggered, an event subprocess can either interrupt the execution of its parent or can run in parallel.                 | Modeling event subprocesses                                                                                                        |

## Procedure

To select an implementation type and set its properties, complete the following
steps:

1. Open the process and switch to Definition.
2. Add the activity that you want to use to the canvas.

Set the properties for the activity, depending on the implementation type.

1. (System Tasks and Decision Tasks only). Select Delete task on
completion if you want to run an automated service that does not require routing. When
you select this check box, audit data for the task is not retained by the workflow server. By
default, this option is disabled.
2. (User Tasks, System Tasks, and Decision Tasks only) In the Task
Header section, specify the following properties: 
Table 2. Properties in the Task Header section

Property
Action

Clean State 
Select to clear the runtime execution state of an activity after it is
complete. By default, this option is disabled. Enable this option only when you do not want
to store execution data (such as variable values) for viewing after the process finished
execution.

Subject
Type a descriptive subject for the task that is generated for the business
user when you run the process. You can also use the embedded JavaScript syntax (for example, <#=tw.local.mySubject#>) to express the
subject.

Narrative
Type an optional description. You can also use the embedded JavaScript syntax to express the narrative. Restriction: Do
not use JavaScript variable references in task
narratives if you need the data to be available after the task completes. When a task is complete,
the data for completed tasks is removed to conserve space. Instead, store the data items in another
location, such as a
database.
3 (User Tasks, Decision Tasks and System Tasks only) In the PrioritySettings section, specify values as needed. Tip: If you prefer to use a JavaScriptexpression with predefined variables to establish the priority settings, clickJS for options.
    1. Under Priority, select one of the default priority codes from
the list: Highest, High, Normal
(the default), Low, or Lowest.
    2. Under Due In, enter a value in the text box and then choose
Minutes, Hours, or Days from
the list. When you choose Days, you can use the text box after the list to
specify hours and minutes.
You can also use the variable selector next to the text box to choose an existing variable
from the library. At run time, the variable reflects the specified value for the time period. Select
the required option from the list: Minutes, Hours, or
Days.Do not set a due in value greater than 800 Hours, Minutes, or Days as
it decreases performance, and the calculation for the due date takes a long time. Instead, use a
JavaScript expression to directly set the due date and avoid the costly calculation that includes
multiple checks for the time or holiday schedule. To set the due date, click
JS, and use the variable selector next to the text box to pass either an
existing Date variable, or create a new one, for example new
TWDate('2020-12-01 09:08:06.02').Note: When you pass a fixed due date, any time or holiday
schedule are ignored.
    3. Under Schedule, select an option from the list. For example,
select 24x7 if you want 24 hours a day, seven days a week to be the time
period in which the resulting tasks from the current activity can be due.
You can leave the Schedule, Timezone, and
Holiday Schedule fields set to (use default). If you do, the
work schedule that is specified for the process is used. For more
information, see Setting the work schedule for a process.
    4. Under Timezone, select the time zone that you want to apply to
the tasks that result from the current activity. For example, you can select
US/Pacific for users who work in California.
    5. Under Holiday Schedule, leave the setting at (use
default) as described in the preceding note, or click JS if you
prefer to use a JavaScript expression. Each holiday
schedule is made up of a list of dates. If you choose JavaScript, you can enter either a String (or String-generated JavaScript) or a JavaScript that returns a TWHolidaySchedule variable. If you use a String,
the Holiday Schedule the run time looks up the name according to those rules. If you use a
TWHolidaySchedule variable, it is assumed that the holiday schedule is
appropriately specified. (Go to the System Data toolkit and open the
TWHolidaySchedule variable to view its parameters.)
4. (User Tasks only) In the Processing Behavior section, select
Automatically flow to next task to run the next task in the sequence
automatically if the task is assigned to the same user. The coach of the next activity is displayed
to the user. Do not use this option to model all user screen flow interactions at the process level
or the token might time out, causing the user to go to the task list instead of the coach. See Automatically starting the user's next task.
5. Click Save or Finish Editing.

- Working with inline user tasks

Inline user tasks are extensions of regular user tasks. Each inline user task implements a specific interface that is implicitly defined by what is exposed to it. When you create a process, an inline user task is automatically generated for the process. The inline user task is already implemented by a hidden and non-editable client-side human service. As a result, you can run your new process immediately after you create it.
- Creating loops for an activity

When you want the runtime task that results from a process activity to be run more than once, you can create a loop. You can create simple loops and multi-instance loops in the designer.
- Configuring conditional activities

You can use conditional wired activities to model steps which are either skipped or completed during run time based on the values of specific process variables. The decision to skip or complete a conditional activity can be made by the runtime user or programmatically, based on scripted rules.
- External implementations

You can use an external implementation when you want a step to be handled by an application that is outside of IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow.
