# Stand-alone references

Stand-alone references have neither an interface nor an implementation
because the implementation is outside the scope of the module. A module
can contain no stand-alone references or one stand-alone references
artifact. When you use stand-alone references, you can use your existing
applications together with SCA components.

Stand-alone references can be used in a mediation module.
