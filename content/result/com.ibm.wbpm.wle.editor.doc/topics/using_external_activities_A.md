# Building a custom application to implement an activity (deprecated)

If you want to build a custom application to implement an activity within a process, you can use
either the IBM Business Automation Workflow Web APIs or REST APIs to enable
your custom application to interact with Business Automation Workflow. For
example, the Business Automation Workflow Web API provides operations that
enable you to pass variables from an Business Automation Workflow BPD to a
custom application and then back to the BPD for continued processing.
