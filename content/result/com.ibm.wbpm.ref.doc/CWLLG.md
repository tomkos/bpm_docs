A list variable of the ''0'' business object type and list length of ''1'' has reached the warning level of ''2'' items. The modification happened in the ''3'' activity of the ''4'' process in the ''5'' instance.
- CWLLG3202W

You are not allowed to create or update an document in the ''0'' instance because the process model does not permit the operation.
- CWLLG3203E

The ''0'' folder does not exist in the ''1'' instance with the ''2'' identifier. It therefore cannot be used as folder for the precondition of the ''3'' activity.
- CWLLG3204E

The evaluation of the ''0'' folder path failed in the ''1'' instance with the ''2'' identifier for the ''3'' activity.
- CWLLG3205E

The lookup of the ''0'' folder in the ''1'' Enterprise Content Management server failed in the ''2'' instance with the ''3'' identifier for the ''4'' activity.
- CWLLG3206W

A content event was successfully correlated to at least one precondition of the activity instances of the ''0'' instance with the ''1'' identifier in the ''2'' snapshot of the ''3'' process application. The event is not delivered to the instance because no event senders team is defined on the ''4'' Enterprise Content Management server.
- CWLLG3207I

A content event was successfully correlated to at least one precondition of the activity instances of the ''0'' instance with the ''1'' identifier in the ''2'' snapshot of the ''3'' process application. The event is not delivered to the instance because the ''4'' event sender is not part of the ''5'' group defined as event senders team at the ''6'' Enterprise Content Management server.
- CWLLG3208I

The ''0'' Enterprise Content Management server defined in the ''1'' snapshot of the ''2'' process application is a ''3'' system by the ''4'' provider. This server supports only the ''5'' query capability. Therefore, items in a folder for this server will not show all the information when a ''getChildren'' operation is invoked.
- CWLLG3209I

The ''0'' Enterprise Content Management server defined in the ''1'' snapshot of the ''2'' process application is a ''3'' system by the ''4'' provider. This server does not support queries using the ''5'' and ''6'' properties in the where clause. Therefore, items in a folder for this server will not show all the information when a ''getChildren'' operation is invoked.
- CWLLG3210E

No IBM Business Automation Workflow property is defined in 100Custom.xml in order to execute syncGroupMembershipForGroups or syncGroupMembershipForAllGroups commands with federated repository.
- CWLLG3211W

The precondition of the ''0'' activity in the ''1'' process instance with the ''2'' identifier can never be triggered because its definition is incomplete. The model is defined in the ''3'' process that is found in the ''4'' snapshot of the ''5'' process application.
- CWLLG3212I

A content event was successfully correlated to a start event which is part of the BPD with name ''0'' in the snapshot ''1'' of the process application ''2''. The event does not start a new instance of this BPD because the ''3'' event sender is not part of the ''4'' group defined as event senders team at the ''5'' Enterprise Content Management server.
- CWLLG3213W

A content event was successfully correlated to a start event which is part of the BPD with name ''0'' in the snapshot ''1'' of the process application ''2''. The event does not start a new instance of this BPD because no event senders team is defined on the ''3'' Enterprise Content Management server.
- CWLLG3214W

Including the 0 group as a member of the 1 group creates a circular group membership, which is not allowed.
- CWLLG3215E

In the ''0 process instance with the ''1'' identifier, the ''2'' expression for the folder of the ''3'' process was evaluated to ''4''. This is not a valid folder name. The expression is defined in the ''5'' process in the ''6'' snapshot of the ''7'' process application.
- CWLLG3216W

The ''0'' process implements a linked process activity in the ''1'' instance with the ''2'' identifier. The process model was authored as a case type in IBM Business Automation Workflow V8.5.5 without a folder business object. Without this folder business object, the folder property synchronization from the folder to the process instance does not work. The process is located in the ''3'' snapshot of the ''4'' process application.
- CWLLG3217W

The ''0'' process implements a linked process activity in the ''1'' instance with the ''2'' identifier. The instance is running the ''3'' process. This process does not specify the automatic synchronization of shared business objects. Without this setting enabled, the folder property synchronization from the folder to the process instance does not work. The process is located in the ''4'' snapshot of the ''5'' process application.
- CWLLG3218E

There are too many references to business object ''0''. The property is not added to the case folder type.
- CWLLG3219W

There is no maximum string length defined on the referenced business object.
- CWLLG3220W

The string length defined on the referenced business object might exceed the maximum length allowed by the content store database. If the string has a character length greater than the maximum limit, deployment will fail.
- CWLLG3221E

The service must have three input parameters of this shared business object type, one input parameter of BOPropertyChange (List) type, and one output parameter of BOValidationError (List) type.
- CWLLG3222E

The ''0'' process uses the Basic Case Management feature for content management. You can only run instances of the process if you have the Basic Case Management feature installed. The process is located in the ''1'' snapshot of the ''2'' process application.
- CWLLG3223E

The ''0'' activity in the ''1'' process instance is trying to run the ''2'' process as a linked process. This linked process has a folder defined that cannot be created because the parent process has no folder. The model is defined in the ''3'' process that is found in the ''4'' snapshot of the ''5'' process application.

Error saving user groups: 0. The groups were not saved due to following reason: 1.

The ''0'' process instance with the ''1'' identifier has a ''2'' folder that references a folder in an external Enterprise Content Management system. This folder reference remains unchanged. However, the latest version of the process defines the folder as managed by IBM Business Automation Workflow. The model is defined in the ''3'' process that is found in the ''4'' snapshot of the ''5'' process application.
- CWLLG3226E

The ''0'' activity in the ''1'' process instance is trying to run the ''2'' process as a linked process. This linked process has a folder defined that cannot be created because the parent process has a folder using the FileNet Connector mode. The model is defined in the ''3'' process that is found in the ''4'' snapshot of the ''5'' process application.

A timeout exception can occur when the size of the process application prevents the deployment from completing in the allotted time (by default, 720 seconds). To fix or prevent this error, use the " com.ibm.bpm.pal.deploy.timeout" system Java Virtual Machine (JVM) property to override the default system behavior. The value is specified in seconds. To revert to the default behavior, delete the system property or set the value to 720.
