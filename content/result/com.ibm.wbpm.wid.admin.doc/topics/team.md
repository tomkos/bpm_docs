# Working in teams

The easiest way to coordinate team development is to use the Process
Center as your team repository. By associating your modules or libraries
with a process application, you can easily share and manage artifacts
that you publish to the Process Center repository. Versioning is handled
for you through snapshots.

If you are working with Integration Designer as a stand-alone product
without IBMÂ® Process Center,
you must use a separate SCM system for versioning and source control.
The topics in this section provide some guidance for working with
SCM systems.

For information about versioning modules and libraries in your
Integration Designer development environment, see Creating
versioned modules and libraries.

- Team development in Integration Designer

IBM Integration Designer provides tools to help teams share resources and collaborate effectively. For teams to work effectively, the environment should be set up appropriately and team members should understand the characteristics of the software configuration management and versioning systems they are applying.
- Using software configuration management systems

Although IBM Workflow Center provides the easiest repository for managing processes and services, you can also use IBM Integration Designer with a number of software configuration management (SCM) systems.
