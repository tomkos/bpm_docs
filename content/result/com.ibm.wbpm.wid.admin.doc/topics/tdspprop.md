Server Logs view

## About this task

## Procedure

2. In the Server Logs view, click the tab of the server console
or server log that contains the record for which you want to display

that is easy to read and assimilate, ensure that Translated is
selected.

5. When you have finished viewing the record properties, click OK to
close the Properties window.
