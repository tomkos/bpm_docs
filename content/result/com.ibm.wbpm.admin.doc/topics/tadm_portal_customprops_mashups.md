# Configuring custom properties

- For a new installation, add the custom properties to the custom resource configuration files, as
described in Customizing Business Automation Workflow on container
properties.
- For an upgrade, you can add the custom properties either to 100Custom.xml (Liberty) or to the
custom resource files (Cloud Pak for Business Automation in different patterns).

The task list is updated whenever a task change occurs that affects the current user. When the auto-refresh is enabled for the task list, the list is populated by a saved search that contains a full-text search, and numerous tasks are created over a short period of time, numerous expensive REST calls are triggered, which affect performance. To eliminate the expensive REST calls, there is a delay refresh period that is set by default to 100 milliseconds.  <server merge="mergeChildren">     <portal merge="mergeChildren">         <auto-refresh-delay merge="replace">100</auto-refresh-delay>     </portal> </server>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | com.ibm.bpm.portal. autoRefreshDelay                                                                                                              |

For example, your team might want to view Process Portal data inside a customer user interface.  <server merge="mergeChildren">     <portal merge="mergeChildren">         <enable-run-in-frame merge="replace">true</enable-run-in-frame>     </portal> </server>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | com.ibm.bpm.social. enableRunInFrame                                                                                                              |

The items in the Launch and Dashboards lists can have multiple snapshots. Each process application snapshot can also refer to toolkits, which in turn, refer to exposed items by type or service subtype. These references can lead to multiple entries in the list for the same exposed item: an entry that comes from the toolkit and an entry from each process application that refers to the toolkit.  <server merge="mergeChildren">     <portal merge="mergeChildren">         <exclude-referenced-from-toolkit merge="replace">startable\_service</exclude-referenced-from-toolkit>     </portal> </server>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | com.ibm.bpm.portal. excludeReferencedFromToolkit                                                                                                  |

This property defines a lazy loading policy: saved searches other than the favorite ones are not displayed immediately but only when the user clicks Show More. This property can take the following values: incremental (default value): Each Show More click displays the additional number of saved searches that is defined by the value of the count parameter. If the list contains more elements than the count value, the user must click Show More again to display the next ones. full: Loads the complete list of elements to display when the user clicks Show More. preload: Loads the complete list of elements for immediate display, without waiting for the user to click Show More. This value reflects the previous default behavior and is not recommended because it reduces display performance.    <server merge="mergeChildren">     <portal merge="mergeChildren">         <launch-list-show-more-strategy merge="replace">incremental</launch-list-show-more-strategy>         <launch-list-show-more-count merge="replace">10</launch-list-show-more-count>     </portal> </server> See also launch-list-show-more-strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | com.ibm.bpm.portal. launchList.showMore.strategy                                                                                                  |

Attention: If a task has a custom web-based user interface that is based on an external implementation, it always opens in a new browser window regardless of the value of this custom property.   <server merge="mergeChildren">     <portal merge="mergeChildren">         <open-task-in-new-window merge="replace">true</open-task-in-new-window>         <disable-open-in-new-window merge="replace">true</disable-open-in-new-window>     </portal> </server> See also disable-open-in-new-window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | com.ibm.bpm.portal. openTaskInNewWindow                                                                                                           |

Based on user roles, restrict-modify-task determines who can see the Modify Task action. In the Modify Task window, you can also restrict who can see the individual modification actions by using the other restrict properties: restrict-modify-task-due: Determines who can see the due date fields. restrict-modify-task-priority: Determines who can see the priority field. restrict-modify-task-reassign: Determines who can see the reassign actions.   Set the value of the property to a comma-separated list of valid security groups, for example tw\_admins1, tw\_admins2. To hide an action, set the value of the property to none. If you do not set a value for a property, everyone can see the action.  <server merge="mergeChildren">     <portal merge="mergeChildren">         <restrict-modify-task merge="replace">tw\_admins1, tw\_admins2</restrict-modify-task>         <restrict-modify-task-reassign merge="replace">tw\_admins1, tw\_admins2</restrict-modify-task-reassign>         <restrict-modify-task-due merge="replace">tw\_admins1, tw\_admins2</restrict-modify-task-due>         <restrict-modify-task-priority merge="replace">tw\_admins1, tw\_admins2</restrict-modify-task-priority>     </portal> </server> Important:  All the listed restrictModifyTask properties take effect on the client side, which means that even though users cannot see the actions in Process Portal, they can still modify the action owners through REST API, as long as they have the authorized action policy. Consistency must be ensured between the configuration property and the action policy.  Note that the property setting cannot apply to all the Process Portal UI pages. For the Process Instance Details and Team Performance pages, which are controlled by the policy setting, you must set the ACTION\_REASSIGN\_TASK action policy independently.

Process Portal uses REST requests to retrieve displayed data. While most requests complete successfully, some might take longer due to various factors, such as the amount of data to be retrieved, server and database latency, and network latency. So, for example, you might see a timeout error message when you click Show More either on the task list in the Work dashboard or on the instance list in the Processes dashboard.  <server merge="mergeChildren">     <portal merge="mergeChildren">         <rest-request-timeout-seconds merge="replace">60</rest-request-timeout-seconds>     </portal> </server>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | com.ibm.bpm.social. restRequestTimeoutSeconds                                                                                                     |

When a human service, such as a dashboard, is started in Process Portal, the instance and its data remains in the user's session memory until the service ends, the user logs out, or the session times out.  By default, human services are not resumable. Therefore, when the user leaves a page, such as a dashboard page, the service instance stays in the user's session. If the user returns to the dashboard, a new service instance is created, which can use much server memory for each user. To allow long-running REST requests time to complete, set the value to a list of process application IDs that contain the services, for example TRD,RD,MAILCOM. For more information, see Enabling resumable services.Attention: Because the ready-to-use dashboards are not resumable, do not add the Process Portal process application to the list.    <server merge="mergeChildren">     <portal merge="mergeChildren">         <z-resumable merge="replace">MAILCOM</z-resumable>     </portal> </server>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | com.ibm.bpm.social. zResumable                                                                                                                    |
