# Undeploying a project or toolkit tip

The tip is the current working version of a project or toolkit. You can use Workflow Center to undeploy a project
or toolkit tip from the Workflow Center server.

When you undeploy a process app tip, all advanced content artifacts and the associated
business-level application (BLA) are removed from the server. However, the process app definition
and other artifacts are still in the repository.  A BLA is a WebSphere® Application
Server configuration artifact
that is created only for a snapshot that has advanced content generated in IBM® Integration
Designer.
