# createObjectStoreForContent fails to run

## Procedure

If the createObjectStoreForContent command fails, perform the
following steps to clean the design object store and target object store:

1. Log in to the ACCE to remove the design object store and target object store if they are
available.
2. Drop the design object store and target object store databases.
3 If your Db2® type is z/OS®, drop the related sequences: DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.AUDITSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.CISEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.REPLSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.SCFSEQUENCE; DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.AUDITSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.CISEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.REPLSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.SCFSEQUENCE; DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.AUDITSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.CISEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.REPLSEQUENCE;DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.SCFSEQUENCE; where:

```
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.AUDITSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.CISEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.REPLSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE SYSADM.SCFSEQUENCE;
 
DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.AUDITSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.CISEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.REPLSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE DOSCT.SCFSEQUENCE;
 
DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.AUDITSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.CISEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.CONTENTQUEUESEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.REPLSEQUENCE;
DROP SEQUENCE TOSCT.SCFSEQUENCE;
```

    - SYSADM is the user that you use to connect to Db2 for z/OS.
    - DOSCT is the database schema of the design object store in your
BPMConfig property file.
    - TOSCT is the database schema of the target object store in your
BPMConfig property file.
4. Recreate the design object store and target object store databases.
