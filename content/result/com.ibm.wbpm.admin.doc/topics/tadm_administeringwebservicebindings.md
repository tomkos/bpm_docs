# Administering web service bindings

- Viewing and updating web service import bindings

Using the administrative console, you can view information about a web service import binding and change the endpoint URL. For the Javaâ„¢ API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) bindings, you can also configure a policy set for the binding.
- Viewing and updating web service export bindings

Using the administrative console, you can view information about a web service export binding (including the WSDL file) and configure properties of the associated web module. For the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) bindings, you can also configure a policy set for the binding.
- Working with web service (JAX-WS) bindings

When you use web service (JAX-WS) bindings with your applications, you can add a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) quality of service (QOS) to the binding. You must first use the administrative console to import the policy set. You can also use the administrative console to make sure that the server is properly configured for use with the web service (JAX-WS) binding.
