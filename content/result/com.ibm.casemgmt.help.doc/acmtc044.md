# The Browse button is disabled after you cancel from the Run Content Navigator File Tracker
window

When file tracking is enabled in IBMÂ® Content
Navigator, you are prompted
to run the file tracker feature when you browse for a document. If you close the window by clicking
Cancel, you return to the Add Document window. However,
the Browse button is disabled, preventing you from browsing to the document
that you want to add.

To resolve this problem, close the Add Document window, clear the browser
cache, then close and restart the browser. When you return to the case, you should be able to use
the Browse button on the Add Document window. When you
see the Run Content Navigator File Tracker window, click
Run, and in the next window, click Allow.
