# Accessibility in IBM Integration Designer

Accessibility features help users with physical disabilities,
such as restricted mobility or limited vision, to use information
technology products successfully.

IBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone,
regardless of age or ability. Use assistive technologies, such as
screen-reader software and digital speech synthesizer, to use what
is displayed on the screen. Consult the product documentation of the
assistive technology for details on using those technologies with
this product.

This product is developed to comply with the accessibility requirements
of software products according to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation
Act of the United States.

These are the major accessibility features in the workbench:

- The workbench uses Microsoft Active
Accessibility (MSAA) APIs to render user interface elements accessible
to assistive technology.
- You can operate all features using the keyboard instead of the
mouse. See the related task.
- You can use screen-reader software such as JAWS (from Freedom
Scientific) and a digital speech synthesizer, such as IBM® ViaVoice® to
enter data and to navigate the user interface.
- You can magnify information presented in the graphical views for
more detail.
- Some tools in this product offer additional accessibility features.
Search for "keyboard shortcuts"  using the Search field
in the online help. (Enclose phrase searches in  double quotation
marks.)
- In addition, some tools offer accessibility features that you
can configure in the Preferences window (Window > Preferences).

- The documentation is available in HTML formats to help users apply screen-reader software
technology.
- Images in the documentation are provided with alternative text so that users with vision
impairments can use the contents of the images.
