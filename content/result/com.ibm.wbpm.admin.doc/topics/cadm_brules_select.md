# Administering business rules and selectors

Whenever you install a module that contains business rules or selectors
or change business rules and selectors on the server, the updates
are logged in the system log or another log that you specify when
you configure business rule and selector audit logging.

- Considerations for modules containing business rules and selectors

Here is some information to consider when you install or delete modules that contain business rules and selectors.
- Overview of business rules

Use business rules to control the behavior of a business practice.
- Business process rules manager

The business process rules manager is a web-based tool that assists the business analyst in browsing and modifying business rule values. The tool is an option of IBMÂ® Workflow Server that you can select to install at profile creation time or after installing the server.
- Business Rules

With Business Rules you can view and change business rules to influence the performance of your business.
- Overview of selector components

As businesses change, the business processes that drive them must change, too. Some of those changes may require that certain processes return different results than as originally designed without changing the design of the process. The selector component provides the framework for that flexibility.
