The user interface has the following main areas.

## Taskbar

For all users, the taskbar offers
options for logging out of the client application and for accessing
online help. If substitution is enabled for the Human Task Manager
in Business Process Choreographer and the Virtual Member Manager service
is configured for WebSphereÂ® Application
Server security,
it also contains the My Substitutes option.
You can use this option to specify another user as your substitute.
This person receives your tasks when you are absent.

This option is available only
when substitution is enabled for the Human Task Manager in Business
Process Choreographer and the Virtual Member Manager service is configured
for WebSphere Application
Server security.

## Navigation pane

If the Views tab is selected,
the navigation pane contains links to views that you use to administer
objects, for example, process instances that you started, or human
tasks that you are authorized to administer. The default user interface
contains links to predefined views for BPEL processes and tasks.

The system administrator can customize the content of the navigation
pane by adding and removing predefined views from the navigation pane
and defining custom views to add to the navigation pane. All users
can define personalized views to be added to their navigation pane.

## Page title

If the Views tab is selected,
the workspace contains pages that you use to view and administer BPEL
process and human task related objects. For information about a page in the workspace,
click the Help icon  on the page.
