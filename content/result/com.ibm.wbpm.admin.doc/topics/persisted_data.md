# Managing persisted data

## The data

IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow retains
the following kinds of data. All of them are candidates for regular
purging or archiving. The tables provide pointers to more specific
guidance.

| Archiving in Workflow Center                                                       | Archiving a project does not delete it or reclaim its space in the database. Archiving marks the project so that it does not show by default in the Workflow Center project list. Archiving a project archives all its snapshots and artifacts.You can archive individual named snapshots instead of archiving an entire project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Rules for sharing and archiving toolkits Archiving and deleting projects Archiving branches Archiving snapshots                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Deleting in Workflow Center (Standard deployment environment)                      | To delete a project, you must first archive it. Then use the BPMRemoveProcessApplication wsadmin command to remove a process application. Removing a project deletes all snapshots and process instances. Use the BPMRemoveToolkit wsadmin command to remove a toolkit. To delete a project with the user interface, select the archived projects; then click Delete next to the project that you want to remove. Deleting a project deletes all snapshots and process instances. An unnamed snapshot is created every time you save artifacts in Process Designer. A named snapshot is simply an unnamed snapshot that has been given a name. These unnamed snapshots are saved in the database to provide a project history, but they should be regularly purged. The LSW\_PO\_VERSIONS table incurs the most growth when unnamed snapshots are not regularly deleted. You can delete any named snapshot manually. You can delete named or unnamed snapshots using the wsadmin commands. You can also configure Business Automation Workflow to delete unnamed snapshots automatically when they are no longer needed.  You can delete snapshots using the BPMSnapshotCleanup wsadmin command. To delete a named snapshot, you must first archive it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Archiving and deleting projects  BPMRemoveProcessApplication command  BPMRemoveToolkit command  Deleting unnamed and archived snapshots, manual  Deleting unnamed snapshots in bulk from a Workflow Center server  BPMSnapshotCleanup wsadmin command Issues with BPMDeleteSnapshot and BPMSnapshotCleanup commands |
| Deleting in Workflow Center (Advanced deployment environment)                      | In addition to the actions described for a Standard deployment environment, you need to be aware of business level applications (BLAs) and enterprise applications that are created on the Workflow Center playback server. If process applications or toolkits in Workflow Center contain a module or library (advanced content), either directly or through a toolkit, a BLA is created for the tip of every process application or toolkit and for every named snapshot that contains advanced content, if one of the following conditions is met: Other projects are associated with the process application or toolkit (other modules, libraries, or any type of IBM Integration Designer, RationalÂ® Application Developer, or Eclipse project). The default module contains executable content: an import or export statement, or a component.   For example, normally a process application or toolkit contains a default module and default library. If the user adds a component, import, or export to the module, or associates any other project, the process application or toolkit is deployed and a BLA is created. Such advanced content can quickly accumulate, and that accumulation can affect the time it takes to start the server, memory use, and general performance.If a snapshot contains Advanced Integration Services (for example, SCA modules or BPEL processes), you can use Workflow Center to undeploy it from the Workflow Center server.  If you are following the faÃ§ade pattern, You usually only need one BLA for the most current snapshot of a process application. To delete BLAs, click the Undeploy option on the Snapshots page of Workflow Center.

| Undeploying a process application or toolkit tip (Advanced deployment environment) | The tip is the current working version of a process application or toolkit. When you undeploy a tip, all Advanced Integration Service artifacts and the associated business level application (BLA) are removed from the server. The process application definition and other artifacts are still present in the repository.If you are using the faÃ§ade pattern and testing the advanced content in an Integration Designer Unit Test Environment (UTE), you almost never need the tip to be deployed. However, since the tip is automatically deployed when changes occur, you need to undeploy the tip if it is not really needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Undeploying a project or toolkit tip BPMUndeploy command Implementing the facade pattern using IBM Business Process Manager Advanced                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Deactivating a snapshot                                                               | Use the BPMDeactivate command to deactivate a snapshot. Deactivating allows all existing instances to complete processing, but no new process instances are created. In a network deployment environment, you must run this command on the node containing the application cluster member that handles Workflow Server or Workflow Center applications. Do not run this command from the deployment manager profile. You can deactivate a running process application snapshot on the Workflow Center server or a Workflow Server. If your process application uses a BPEL process as the main entry component, you must stop the corresponding BPEL template in the WebSphere administrative console. If this BPEL process invokes a BPD, you must allow any existing instances to complete after you stop the template but before you deactivate the snapshot. | Administering BPEL process and task templates BPMDeactivate command                                                                                  |
| Deleting snapshots from IBM BPM Standard on Workflow Server                           | Over time, a workflow server can accumulate many snapshots of a process application. You can delete snapshots that are no longer in use. When you delete a snapshot, you also delete any business process definitions that are associated with it.The snapshot cannot have any running instances. The snapshot cannot be active. Toolkit snapshots are not automatically deleted when process application snapshots are deleted. Use the BPMShowSnapshot command to obtain a list of toolkit snapshots on which a process application depends. If those toolkit snapshots are not needed by any other process application or toolkit, delete them using the BPMDeleteSnapshot command.                                                                                                                                                                           | BPMDeactivate command Deleting snapshots on workflow servers BPMDeleteSnapshot command Issues with BPMDeleteSnapshot and BPMSnapshotCleanup commands |

| Deleting completed tasks from the runtime database                                    | Long running process instances can produce a number of completed tasks in the runtime database. When the number of completed tasks gets large enough, they can affect the performance of the runtime database. You can resolve the problem by purging the runtime database of the completed tasks, which are no longer needed at run time. Note that deleting the completed tasks does not delete them from the system. The completed tasks are still in the archive database. Deleting completed tasks is also useful if you are migrating process instances. By removing completed tasks, you are migrating only the information needed by the process instances in their new location.                                                                                                                                                                        | BPMTasksCleanup wsadmin command                                                                                                                      |
| Deleting execution data about user, decision, or system tasks when the task completes | By default, the runtime execution state of an activity is saved after it is complete.

You need to stop the processes and undeploy the content before you delete the snapshot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Deleting snapshots on workflow servers BPMDeactivate command BPMStop command BPMUndeploy command BPMDeleteSnapshot command                           |

| Deleting Business Process Choreographer objects (Advanced deployment environment)     | Various database objects accumulate in a running system, for example, audit log entries, task and process instances, task and process templates, and people queries. Regularly running administrative scripts to delete objects that are no longer needed from the Business Process Choreographer databases can help prevent wasting storage space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Deleting Business Process Choreographer objects                                                                                                      |

Security groups are never deleted when process instances or tasks are deleted.  A team, formerly called a participant group, is associated with a snapshot.  A temporary group is formed if you assign a task to a list of users or groups. Temporary groups are deleted from the server automatically when no task uses them any more. An internal group can contain users from more than one user repository. Internal groups are created and deleted from the Process Admin Console.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | IBM Business Automation Workflow default group types                                                                                                 |

The system performs the cleanup based on these configuration properties: cleanupMaxVersionCount Specifies the number of versions that should be kept. For example, a cleanupMaxVersionCount of 4 indicates that at least 4 versions should be kept.  cleanupMinAge Specifies a time in hours that prevents recent versions from being deleted. For example, a cleanupMinAge of 48 indicates that a version that was created less than 48 hours ago should not be deleted, regardless of the cleanupMaxVersionCount specified.                                                                                                                                                                   | Cleaning up shared business objects                                                                                                                  |

You can delete the content of the wstemp directory after shutting down the deployment manager. Some other WebSphere log files purge data automatically.  The SystemOut.log file contains messages about significant events from the JVM process. Log files automatically roll over and purge the oldest data. You can use a background batch process to capture the oldest logs before rollover.  Never delete the transaction log. It is self-cleaning. | IBM WAS log files Transaction log file |
