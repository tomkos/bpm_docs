# Cannot cancel the check-out of documents in Case Client that
were added from an Alfresco CMIS repository

However, if the case folder contains external documents, the Cancel check out action is disabled
for the documents from the Alfresco CMIS repository
after you perform a Checkout action. Thus, you cannot cancel the check-out of the documents in
Case Client.

To work around this issue, browse to the documents in the Alfresco CMIS repository and cancel the check-out.
