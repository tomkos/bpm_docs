# Managing stored queries

## About this task

A stored query is a query that is stored in the database
and identified by a name. A private and a public stored query can have the
same name; private stored queries from different owners can also have the
same name.

You can have stored queries for BPEL process objects,
task objects, or a combination of these two object types.

- Parameters in stored queries

A stored query is a query that is stored in the database and identified by a name. The qualifying tuples are assembled dynamically when the query is run. To make stored queries reusable, you can use parameters in the query definition that are resolved at run time.
- Managing public stored queries

Public stored queries are created by the system administrator. These queries are available to all users.
- Managing private stored queries for other users

Private queries can be created by any user. These queries are available only to the owner of the query and the system administrator.
- Working with your private stored queries

If you are not a system administrator, you can create, run, and delete your own private stored queries. You can also use the public stored queries that the system administrator created.
