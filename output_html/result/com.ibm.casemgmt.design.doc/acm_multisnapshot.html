<h1>Creating flexible case activities</h1>

<p>As of 23.0.2, you can enable users to initiate more flexible activities that start from the same
snapshot as their parent case
instance. The Starts from the parent case
snapshot
option in the configuration properties of the activity enables you to initiate activities from a snapshot that reflects the business
process logic in place when the case instance was created, rather than the logic of the default case
snapshot.</p>

<h2>Expected activity behaviors</h2>

<ul>
<li>The type of environment that is being used, Process Center (development
environment) vs Process Server (production environment).</li>
<li>Where the case started from and the activities within the case are initiated, by clicking the
Play button from the snapshot or from the solution process
application.</li>
<li>Whether the Starts from the parent case
snapshot
checkbox in the configuration properties of the activity is selected or clear.</li>
</ul>

| A solution with snapshot1 has a case type case1 defined with an activity that is configured to a process, say activity1with process1. Snapshot2 has a new external toolkit that is added with a process say process2. An activity with an existing process activity2 is created under case type case1 and uses “This project” as the workflow project. Both snapshots are activated. | If a case instance is created out of snapshot1, activity2 appears as 'failed' because the toolkit for process2 is not available in snapshot1 of “This project”.      |</p>

<h2>Using flexible case activities for case instances existing from previous releases</h2>

<p>Before you use the flexible case activities feature, you need to update the case instances that
exist from previous releases by using scripts.</p>

<p>The following sample query fetches case instances of a specific case type and created before a
specific date that is still in Working state:</p>

<p><code>
SELECT [This], [CmAcmCaseIdentifier], [CmAcmCaseState], [Name] FROM [CmAcmCaseFolder] WHERE [DateCreated] &lt; 
20230809T183000Z AND [CmAcmCaseIdentifier] like 'TE\_loancasetype%' AND [CmAcmCaseState] = 2 OPTIONS(TIMELIMIT 180,COUNT\_LIMIT 1000)
</code></p>

<p><code>
importClass(Packages.com.filenet.api.property.Properties);
importClass(Packages.com.filenet.api.constants.RefreshMode);
function OnCustomProcess (CEObject)
{ 
     CEObject.refresh(); 
     CEObject.getProperties().putValue("CmAcmSnapshotId", "2064.828db841-dd71-4323-a99a-43a6102bc00d");
     CEObject.getProperties().putValue("CmAcmSnapshotName", "Test1"); CEObject.save(RefreshMode.REFRESH);
 }
</code></p>
