# To-Do List widget

To-do tasks can be used to record information or track completion of case-related tasks that
occur outside of the workflow system. For example, if the solution that you are designing is for
automobile claims and one of the case types is for automobile accidents, you can create to-do tasks
such as calling the claimant, calling the repair shop, uploading accident photos, and so on.

In Case Builder, you add to-do tasks for case types. Then, you
can edit To-Do List widget settings to select the to-do tasks to display in the To-Do List widget.
You can also specify which buttons to include on the toolbars for to-do items and the to-do
list.

You enable users to create quick tasks by selecting the Enable case
workers to create quick tasks option for the case type.

- To-Do List widget events

The To-Do List widget uses incoming events to display a list of items that require   handling by the user.
