<h1>Client-side human services for case applications</h1>

<ul>
<li>If you're new to case, use client-side human services to build your case pages by following the
same method you use to build process pages in Workflow Designer. Client-side human services use
newer technologies and provide a library of reusable assets that are called views that you can use
to dynamically build your case user interfaces. You can create your own library of views and apply
themes to achieve a consistent look throughout your client application.</li>
<li><p>If you upgraded from IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow, you're likely familiar with
using classic widgets to create your client application. You might have a library of custom widgets
that you want to continue using. Pages that you created by using widgets continue to work, and you
can keep updating them. Consider using client-side human services in your new applications, or
incrementally add client-side human service pages to your application. Client-side human services
provide the flexibility to mix and match with widget-based pages, and provide reusable views that
you can use instead of building monolithic widgets. Similar to building a web page, you can arrange
your views however you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved user experience
Give your users a better experience with modern pages and a
consistent look throughout the application. Users work faster in case activities that display
information in the same page without having to switch between pages or windows. They can create,
manage, and complete their work in the same case page.</p></li>
<li>Improved developer experience
Build your client application in a way that is
consistent with building process user interfaces. Have more control and flexibility over how you
construct your UI. Create your page elements in Workflow Designer by using views that are provided
in the UI toolkit and the Case toolkit, which includes views that are especially designed to create
case pages. With reusable views, you can build pages consistently and easily maintain and reuse
assets. See Views in the Case toolkit.</li>
<li>Improved performance
Client-side human services reduce server load by mostly running
on the client side in the web browser. They make calls for data to the server only when necessary,
unlike case widgets, which call the server for all processing, data interactions, and
responses.</li>
<li>Modernize your client application incrementally
Continue using your widget-based
pages and transition some of your pages to client-side human services by using adapter pages. You
can display both client-side human service views and case widgets in the same page in Case Client, however, you cannot pass data
between the two.</li>
