# Migrating development projects to IBMÂ® Cloud Pak for Business
Automation

You can prepare your projects first in the on-premises Process Designer before importing them
into Business Automation Studio. Alternatively,
you can import your process apps and case solutions into IBM Business Automation Studio, fix incompatible
artifacts, and continue to develop them in the Workflow designer.
