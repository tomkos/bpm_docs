| 42060  | ACTIVITY\_CUSTOMPROPERTY\_SET          | This event is emitted when a custom property of an activity instance is changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 42061  | ACTIVITY\_BRANCH\_CONDITION\_TRUE       | This event is emitted when the case condition of a choice activity evaluates to true. There is, at most, one event with the case element condition set to true for each navigated choice activity instance. That is, non-entered case elements are not honored by an event, and otherwise elements provoke the same event as condition case elements.                                                            |
| 42062  | ACTIVITY\_ALL\_BRANCH\_CONDITIONS\_FALSE | This event is emitted when no case element was used and no otherwise element exists. In this case, the navigation continues at the end of the choice construct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  42063 | ACTIVITY\_JUMPED                      | This event is emitted after the final activity event of the source activity of the jump action and before the first event of the target activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 42064  | ACTIVITY\_SKIP\_REQUESTED              | Skip activity requested. This event is emitted if the corresponding activity is not in an active state and a skip or cancelSkipRequest API is called. In this case, the request has no immediate effect on the navigation. The event contains a flag to distinguish between a skip and a cancelSkipRequest call. The ECSCurrentID for the event to be skipped is not set to the AIID of the associated activity. |
| 42065  | ACTIVITY\_SKIPPED\_ON\_REQUEST          | Event skipped on request. This event is emitted when the navigation after an activity that is marked for skipping is continued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  42069 | ACTIVITY\_TIMER\_RESCHEDULED           | This event is emitted when a rescheduleTimer request is processed. This event can be produced for wait, human task, invoke, and pick activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  42070 | ACTIVITY\_SKIPPED\_ON\_EXIT\_CONDITION   | This event is emitted when an exit condition of the onEntry type evaluates to true, and the activity is skipped for this reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  42072 | ACTIVITY\_CHILD\_PROCESS\_TERMINATING   | This event is emitted if the corresponding activity is an invoke activity in the running state, has a child process, and the forceRetry, forceComplete, or skip API is called or the activity expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  42073 | ACTIVITY\_CONDITION\_FORCED            | An activity that has stopped because of an error evaluating a join condition was forced to continue navigating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  42074 | ACTIVITY\_LOOP\_CONDITION\_FORCED       | An activity that has stopped because of an error evaluating a repeat-until or while loop condition was forced to continue navigating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  42075 | ACTIVITY\_FOR\_EACH\_COUNTERS\_FORCED    | An activity that has stopped because of an error evaluating a for-each loop condition was forced to continue navigating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
