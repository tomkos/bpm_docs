# Rolling back fix packs for IBM Integration
Designer

## Before you begin

## About this task

Use the rollback feature if you have applied an update
to a product package, and decide later that you want to remove the
update and revert to the earlier version of the product. When you
use the rollback feature, the Installation Manager uninstalls the
updated resources, and reinstalls the resources from the previous
version.

See the
help in the Installation Manager for more information on using the
Rollback wizard.

To roll back an updated package, complete the
following steps:

## Procedure

1. On the Start page of the Installation Manager, click Roll
Back to start the Rollback wizard.
2. From the Roll Back Packages list,
select the package that you want to roll back.
3. Complete the wizard according to the on-screen instructions.
