# Using values from data pools

## Before you begin

## About this task

## Procedure

1. In the integration test client value editor, right-click
the value that you want to replace with a value from the data pool,
then select Use Value from Pool. A read-only
instance of the data pool editor opens. (Note, however, that if no
data pool yet exists or only the pre-6.1.2 global data pool exists,
the data pool editor will not open. Instead, the New Data Pool wizard
will automatically open to enable you to create a new data pool. Information
about creating a new data pool is found in the topic "Adding new data
pools.")
2 In the Data pool field, completeone of the following steps:
    - If you want to use a value from an existing data pool, either
accept the data pool that is currently specified or select another
data pool from the list of available data pools. Alternatively, you
can select Browse to locate and select a data
pool.
    - If you want to create a new data pool, select New.
Information about creating a new data pool is found in the topic "Adding
data pools."
3. If you want to filter the contents of the Values list
in the data pool editor to show only values of another simple or complex
type, specify the type in the Filter for type field.
For example, you could specify string and the Values list
would be filtered to show only values with a string data type.
4. In the Values list, select the data
pool value that you want to use.
5. Click OK.
