<h1>Sending a link to a case in an email opens an empty tab in</h1>

<p>the Firefox browser</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<ul>
<li>Send Link to Case in the Case List widget
menu</li>
<li>Send Link to Case by Email in the Case
Toolbar widget.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Firefox dialog box opens in a new tab so that your work
in Case Client is not affected.
If you select a web email client, the login page for that email client
opens in this tab. If you select a desktop email client, the email
client opens in your desktop. However, the blank tab remains open
in the browser.</p>
