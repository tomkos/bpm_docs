# Traditional: Revoking a Process Center registration
(deprecated)

## Before you begin

- After a registration has been revoked, you cannot share new toolkits with that process center.
Toolkits that the process center previously shared and subscribed to become local to that process
center. If new snapshots of a toolkit that the process center subscribed to are released, they are
not available to that process center.
- When you re-create a registration after revoking it, all the links to the shared toolkit are
reestablished. The process center with the reinstated registration can again see changes that have
been made to the subscribed toolkit.

## About this task
