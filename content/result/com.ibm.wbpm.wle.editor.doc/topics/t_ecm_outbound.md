# Outbound interactions with Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems

- Outbound operations for external ECM systems and BPM stores

Use standard Enterprise Content Management (ECM) operations to interact with external ECM systems defined in the process application settings page. These operations can also be used to develop applications, which use repositories that are called BPM stores.
- Authentication scenarios

You can grant access to an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) server in several ways. You can set a user ID and password for the process application that is recognized by the ECM system. You can design a process to use personal credentials to control access to specific documents and folders on the ECM server. Or, you can design a process that uses each method of authentication for different steps.
- CMIS web service clients

When you access a content management system from a process applicationworkflow automation by using Content Management Interoperability Service (CMIS) integration, a web service client is used.
- How to use views to store or view documents

In client applications, you can store or view documents from an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) server by using functions that work with your search results.
- Integrating with an ECM system or a BPM document store

Use a service to allow a business process developed in IBMÂ® Process Designer to work with an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system or a BPM document store.
- Building a query for an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) search operation

A graphical interface helps you build a query to an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) server.
- Working with a search result programmatically

Search results can be substantial. Instead of working with a large search result in a user interface, you may want to parse the search results programmatically.
- Working with document content

To work with the content of documents, you can use the ECMContentStream data type to wrap a content stream and return information about the stream. A content stream is a stream of data that contains the content of a document, such as a word processing document or an image.
- Data mapping in Enterprise Content Management (ECM) operations

Each operation requires that variables be mapped to the input and output fields. Using the auto-map function automatically creates and assigns variables of the right type to each field.
- Authorization of documents and folders in a process

You can assign various authorization levels to process documents and folders, depending on the user role for the process instance.
