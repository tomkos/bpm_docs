- Connections from Integration Designer to the unit test environment (UTE)

In Integration Designer, a server in the Servers view for the unit test environment can be automatically or manually created. If you have installed the UTE locally, a new server is automatically created when you start Integration Designer and use a new workspace. If you are working with a remote UTE server or using a workspace that was created before the UTE was installed locally, you can manually create a server.
