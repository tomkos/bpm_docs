# Activating installed process applications

## About this task

Only the process is activated when you activate a process application.

If the process application uses BPEL processes and the templates were stopped (as
described in Administering BPEL process and task templates), follow the instructions in that section to start
the templates again.

When you activate a process application snapshot that contains an Advanced
Integration service, you are actually starting the associated business level application (BLA). You
can use the WebSphere Application Server administrative console to verify that the BLA is in the
expected state.

## Procedure

To activate a process application snapshot, perform the
following steps:

1. From the Process Admin Console Installed Apps page, select
the installed snapshot.
2. Activate the snapshot by clicking Activate Application.
