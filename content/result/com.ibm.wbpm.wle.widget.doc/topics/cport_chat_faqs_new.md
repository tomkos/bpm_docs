# Instant messaging in Process Portal: Frequently
asked questions

## Why does the Chat option on
the Experts tab not work for me?

1. Check your browser settings. Ensure that you have not blocked
pop-up windows.
2 Depending on which browser you use, perform one of the followingactions.
    - If you are using Internet Explorer, reload the page if you are
prompted to do so when you start your chat session to accept the certificate
for Sametime
Connect.
    - If you are using a browser other than Internet Explorer, point
your browser to the following URL, and accept the certificate for Sametime
Connect.https://sthost:secureport/stwebclient/popup.jspWhere: 
sthost
The name of your Sametime
Connect server.
secureport
The port for the Sametime
Connect server.
    - If you are using Process Portal on
a mobile device, such as an Apple iPad, you might have issues with
receiving chat messages.  If your Process Portal environment
has Sametime
Connect enabled,
although you can start a chat session on your mobile device, other
users might not be able to start chat sessions with you. Switch from
the Sametime
Connect tab
to another tab, and then back again, and the missed message is displayed.
3. If you still experience problems starting a chat session, contact
your system administrator.
