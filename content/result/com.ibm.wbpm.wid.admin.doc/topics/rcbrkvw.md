# Breakpoints view in the integration debugger

The Breakpoints view is shown in the following figure:

In the Breakpoints view, each breakpoint is identified by
one of several symbols (which are also used in the component editors). These
symbols are described in the following table:

| Symbol   | Description                                                                                            |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          | The breakpoint is installed and enabled                                                                |
|          | The breakpoint is installed and disabled                                                               |
|          | The breakpoint is enabled but restricted to one or more threads of the business process                |
|          | The breakpoint is enabled in a line of source code in the Javaâ„¢ snippet editor or the condition editor |
|          | The breakpoint is enabled in all threads of the component                                              |
|          | The breakpoint is disabled                                                                             |

If you double-click a breakpoint in the Breakpoints view, the component
editor that contains the breakpoint is opened.

If you are debugging
a business process, you can select a breakpoint in the Breakpoints view and
then open the breakpoint Properties window to enable or disable the breakpoint,
apply hit counts to the breakpoint, or restrict the breakpoint to specific
process threads.
