# Interaction between the Process Designer
and the deprecated desktop Process Designer

You can create most of the artifacts in the web editor, but there are some artifacts that you can
edit only in the desktop editor, for example business process definitions (BPDs). For more
information, see Where to edit Process Designer artifacts.

- The Process Designer opens by default when
you open a process application or a toolkit from Workflow Center. To open a process application in the desktop
editor, you must launch Workflow Center from the
desktop Process Designer.
- The two editors are integrated through Workflow Center and the correct desktop or web editor
seamlessly opens when you click an artifact.
- If you are working in the desktop Process Designer and you open an artifact that is created in the Process Designer, for example a process, the Process Designer is started and the artifact is opened in
the web editor.
- If you have Process Designer open on your desktop
and you are working in the web editor opened from the desktop Process Designer, you can edit certain artifacts in
the desktop editor. When you click the artifacts in the web editor, they open in the desktop editor
so that you can edit them.
- If you start the Process Designer from the
desktop Process Designer, you cannot switch to
Workflow Center from the Process Designer. You must return to the desktop Process Designer and open Workflow Center from there.
