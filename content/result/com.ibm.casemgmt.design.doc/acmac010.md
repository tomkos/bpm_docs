# Configuring and administering case management from the command line

## Before you begin

- Configuring case features from the command line

You must configure case features before you can use it in production. Configuring your system prepares the Case Builder application and the Case Client application for deployment on the application server. After you deploy these applications, you can create, test, manage, deploy, and work with your business solutions.
- Command syntax

Syntax diagrams describe how you must enter commands and what options are available.
