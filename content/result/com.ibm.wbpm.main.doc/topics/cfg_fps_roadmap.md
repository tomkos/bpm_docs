# Roadmap for configuring Process Federation Server and
federated environments

To allow non-secure communication between Process Federation Server and a federated
Business Automation Workflow system or
IBM BPM system V8.5.7
cumulative fix 2017.03 or later with no certificate exchange, you must enable non-secure HTTP
transport using the configureBPMTransportSecurity AdminTask. See configureBPMTransportSecurity command for more details.

The following table shows in greater detail the order in which to configure the components in
the federated environment and includes an overview of the steps to perform for the configuration. It
also has specific information for the two configuration paths. The associated interactive diagram
provides an at-a-glance view of the configuration steps and quick links to the relevant
topics.

You can use the Process Federation Server validation tool
to check certain configuration steps. These steps are indicated by an asterisk (*) in the table. For
more information, see Validating the Process Federation Server and federated environment configuration .
