<h1>Case management</h1>

<p>IBM® Business Automation
Workflow simplifies the job of designing
and building a case management system and provides a graphical user interface for case workers to
easily manage cases. You can design a case management solution that is based on closely related
cases and then deploy that solution into a production environment. Case workers can then complete
work items associated with cases.</p>

<p>Before you enable the case features in Business Automation Workflow, you should ensure that you
have a Business Automation Workflow license. If
you are upgrading from IBM Business Process Manager
 (BPM) or IBM Case
Manager, you must also
upgrade your license to Business Automation Workflow.</p>

<ul>
<li>Designing your case management solution and application</li>
</ul>

<p>To design a case management solution, identify what user activities are needed to accomplish the main user goal. Decide what business-level activities and steps you need, and then group those activities and steps into a case. As you identify the content needed to complete those steps, decide who will work on the content and what does or does not need to happen to complete it.
- Administering your case management system</p>

<p>To administer your case management system, you complete tasks such as setting up project areas, monitoring system performance, and modifying system wide configurations. You can also back up, restore, or tune the system.
- Configuring and administering case management from the command line</p>

<p>You can configure and administer case features from the command line instead of using the Case configuration tool and Case administration client user interfaces. You can generate tasks, run tasks, list the tasks in a profile, add passwords to task files, move or remove a task, and run a test on some tasks.
- Migrating and deploying case management solutions</p>

<p>After you develop and test a case management solution, you can migrate the solution to another environment. After you migrate a solution to a development environment, you can edit, deploy, and test the solution. After you migrate a solution to the production environment, you can deploy the solution to make it available to your case workers.
- Programming case solutions</p>

<p>Use built-in functions to customize your case solutions so that your users get the experience and capabilities they require.
- Working with case solutions in Case Client</p>

<p>From Case Client, you can process work items that are assigned to you and search for and view information about the associated cases. You can add unplanned tasks to be completed by you or others. You can assign users and groups to roles and reassign multiple work items by user role.
- Troubleshooting case</p>

<p>You can configure logging to help you troubleshoot case problems. In addition, you can resolve typical errors by following the procedures in this section.
- Using FileNet processes to implement activities</p>

<p> Traditional:  If you upgraded from IBM Business Automation Workflow, you can still use case activities implemented by  FileNet®  processes.</p>
