# Creating rules within rule sets from templates

## Before you begin

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Click New Rule from Template to display the list of available templates
for the rule.
2 Select a template and do the following:
    1. In the Name field enter the name of the new rule.
    2. In the Display Name field enter a display name for the new rule.
The display name does not need to be unique for the rule. It can be any string value and can
contain special characters. If you do not specify a display name, the Name
value will be used for the display name.Note: To synchronize the display name with the name value,
select the corresponding Synchronize Name check box in the
Action field. If the check box is selected, the display name of the rule is
disabled and cannot be modified.
    3. Specify the values for the rule in the input fields or select the variables from the drop-down
lists.
    4. Enter a description for the rule.
    5. Click Add.
3. Click the up or down arrows in the Action field to place the rule in the
proper order.

Note: The order of rule processing is determined by the order of the rule statements in the if/then
rule set. Therefore, when you modify or add a rule, you need to be sure that it is in the correct
sequence.
4. Click Save.
