# Dashboards

A dashboard displays data from one or more business processes. Although the dashboard can display
the data in many different ways, typically it uses charts, graphs, and other visualization user
interfaces. A dashboard can also contain other content.

Using dashboards, users can see an overview of the data or filter it to concentrate on a
particular aspect. If users have the appropriate permissions, they can use the dashboard to interact
with the data. For example, a graph in a dashboard shows all the business processes. It identifies
which processes might need attention because they have instances that are at risk or overdue. A
process owner can use the dashboard to identify the problem and then act in a way that enables
process instances to finish on time. Similarly, team leaders can use a dashboard to check the status
of work items and reassign work to balance the workload between team members.

Users can access dashboards by using Workplace or Process Portal.

Workplace and Process Portal provide access to dashboards, work interfaces, and user preferences from one URL. Process Portal includes some
standard, ready-to-use dashboards that help you analyze and manage your business processes, such as
the Team Performance and Process Performance dashboards.
Workplace provides
the start page where you can view and organize your tasks, workflows, and cases, and includes a
ready-to-use Teams dashboard that helps you manage your teams and analyze and
act on their performance. Note that the Teams dashboard is available only in
federated Workplace
environments, which require the deployment of Process Federation Server.

In addition, your Process Portal installation might
include company-specific dashboards to help you manage other aspects of business processes. A
business programmer or analyst creates these dashboards by exposing human services and by using the
coaches of those human services as the user interfaces of the dashboard. Workplace installation can
provide access to custom dashboards that provide information tailored to specific business needs.
For quick navigation, you can copy and share or bookmark the URL of your Workplace pages.

If an administrator exposes the dashboard as a URL, users can access the dashboard outside of
Workplace or Process Portal. Users can also access the dashboard as a portlet for WebSphereÂ®
Portal.
