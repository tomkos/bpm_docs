your case management application to another target environment, complete
the following steps:</p>

<p>1 Export or generate versions of the translated solutionartifacts: Option Description Content-related artifacts: Property templates, choice lists, document classes, case types,and activities Use IBM速FileNet速 Deployment Manager toexport the translated assets that are managed by the Content Platform Engine in the target objectstore: Be aware of the following situations: Form templates and localization proxy document Use IBMFileNet Deployment Manager toexport translated assets that are managed by the Content Platform Engine in the target objectstore: Process-related artifacts Create a compressed file that contains the PEAuthoredNames.jar file,which is in the ICN_install_path \ECMClient\configure\explodedformat\navigator\WEB-INF\lib folder.

| Content-related artifacts: Property templates, choice lists, document classes, case types, and activities | Use IBM速 FileNet速 Deployment Manager to export the translated assets that are managed by the Content Platform Engine in the target object store: Create an export manifest and add property templates, choice lists, and class definitions, including case types and document classes and activities. Set the Include Options to none. Export the assets. Create a compressed file to use as a deployment package.  Be aware of the following situations: If your solution exposes all of the document classes in the target object store in case client, you must translate all document classes. If your solution is configured to expose only the document classes that are defined in your solution, then translate only those document classes. You need to translate only discretionary activities. Automatic or manual activities do not use translated names at run time by design. |
| Form templates and localization proxy document                                                            | Use IBM FileNet Deployment Manager to export translated assets that are managed by the Content Platform Engine in the target object store: Create an export manifest with the translated form template documents and localization proxy document.  Export the assets. Tip:  If the translated assets exist in the same object store folder as the originals,  you can export the entire folder. Use the IBM FileNet Deployment Manager  Include Options to include all of the folder contents. If you want to manage the translated forms separately from the originals, then create a separate export manifest for the translated forms.  Create a compressed file to use as a deployment package.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

<p>2 By using the IBM Administration Console forContent Platform Engine ,browse to the design_object_store /IBM Business AutomationWorkflow /Solutions/solution_name folder.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a subfolder of any valid name in this folder,
such as NonICMAssets, if the subfolder does not
exist.</li>
<li>Add all of the compressed files that contain the exported
translations to the design_object_store/IBM Business Automation
Workflow/Solutions/solution_name/NonICMAssets folder
in the source environment design object store.
Add each
compressed file as a separate document object and check in as major
version.</li>
<li>By using the Case administration client, export your solution from the source domain. 
The compressed files that contain the translations are checked into the solution folder, so
the exported solution package contains the translations.</li>
<li>Using the Case administration client,
import your solution into the target domain.</li>
<li>Deploy the solution to the target environment
in the target domain.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you design and create a solution, you must decide what the solution locale
is. The solution locale refers to the locale of display names, such as case properties, case types,
activities, and other solution artifacts that you create with Case Builder. When you deploy the solution to a target environment
for the first time, you must deploy the solution under the same locale to ensure that the display
names are preserved.
If you use Case Builder to deploy the solution,
change the browser locale. 
If you use the Case administration client to
deploy the solution, change the browser locale or change the application language value in the
Change Language and Locale Settings window. 
If you use the Case configuration tool
to deploy the solution, change the JVM locale in which the Case configuration tool runs. Edit the
configmgr.ini or configmgr_cl.ini file in the
ICM_install_dir\configure folder and change the
nl value to specify your language locale. The default value is en_US.
6. Deploy any assets that are not part of IBM Business Automation
Workflow into the target domain
that is used by your solution.
If a single deployment package
contains the original and translated form templates and localization
proxy document, deploying these other assets also deploys those translated
form assets.
7. By using the IBM Administration Console for
Content Platform Engine,
browse to the IBM Business Automation
Workflow/Solutions/solution_name/NonICMAssets folder
in the design object store in the target domain. Download the translated
artifacts.
8 Deploy the translated artifacts of your solution to the target domain. Option Description Content-related artifacts: Use IBMFileNet Deployment Manager to import thedeployed data set that contains the property templates, choice lists, and class definitions. Importinto the target object store that the solution was deployed to. In the import wizard, choose thefollowing import options: Form templates and localization proxy document Use IBMFileNet Deployment Manager to import thetranslated form templates and localization proxy document into the target object store that thesolution was deployed to.

The previous step of deploying non-IBM Business AutomationWorkflow assets also deployed thetranslated form templates and localization proxy document.

They aredeployed to the target environment by deploying the solution.</p>
