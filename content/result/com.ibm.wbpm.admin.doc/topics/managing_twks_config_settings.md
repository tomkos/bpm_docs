# The 100Custom.xml file and configuration

## About this task

- Location of 100Custom configuration files

 The location of 100Custom XML configuration files and the system files that contain the default values depends on the server type that you are configuring. It is also dependent on whether your environment is a stand-alone environment or a clustered network deployment environment.
- Creating a 100Custom.xml configuration file

To modify workflow server configurations, you must create a 100Custom.xml file if it does not exist. Then you can change the configuration properties in the 100Custom.xml files of the deployment environment to override the default configurations in other XML configuration files (such as the 99Local.xml file).
- Deploying a 100Custom.xml file to a deployment environment

You can customize certain Business Automation Workflow configurations by using 100Custom.xml files. After you create a 100Custom.xml file with the required changes, you must deploy it to your deployment environment.
- Modifying individual configuration properties

Use the appropriate 100Custom.xml files in your topology to modify the configuration properties of the workflow server or Workflow Center.
