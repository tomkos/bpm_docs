# Modeling business process definitions (deprecated)

You create two types of processes, depending on which editor you are using. To model a process in
the desktop Process Designer, you use a BPD. To model
a process in the Process Designer, you use a
process. At run time, both BPDs and processes become process instances.

- Using the desktop IBM Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Depending on the artifact that you are working with, you use either the eclipse-based Process Designer on the desktop, or the Process Designer.
- Problems starting the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Resolve problems starting the desktop Process Designer, for example during login, by using various techniques such as correcting invalid connection information or logging errors that are captured with java.util.logging.
- Creating BPDs in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
A business process definition (BPD) is a major unit of logic in IBM Business Automation Workflow. You create BPDs in the desktop IBM Process Designer. You can also run your processes inside Process Designer, and you can analyze and simulate them in order to optimize your business activity.
- Converting BPDs to processes

Convert business process definitions (BPDs) to processes so that you can work with them in the Process Designer.
- Instance names in BPDs and processes

When the flow of an instance progresses from a parent BPD to a child linked BPD, the instance name changes to reflect the child linked BPD. However, when the flow of an instance progresses from a parent process to a child process, the instance retains the name of the parent process.
- Importing BPMN 2.0 artifacts into an existing process application in the desktop Process Designer

If you do not want to create a process application that is based on a BPMN model, import the BPMN files into an existing process application.
