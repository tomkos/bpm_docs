# Preparing the design environment

- Copying existing metadata into the case management development environment

You can use FileNetÂ® Deployment Manager to export and import FileNet P8 assets from the object store in a production environment into the case management development environment target object store. You can then use those assets, mainly metadata, when you design a solution. For example, you can reuse property templates, document classes, or choice value lists from the production environment where the solution will be deployed.
- Importing the solution template to the target environment

After you create the solution template in the source environment, you can import it to the target environment.
