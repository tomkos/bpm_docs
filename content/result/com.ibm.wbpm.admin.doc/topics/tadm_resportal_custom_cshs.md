- Linking to Heritage Process Portal from Process Portal

Process Portal is enabled by default in all Business Automation Workflow deployment environments. However, your users might also need to work with Heritage Process Portal (deprecated), for example, if they use IBM Connections or collaborate on work.
- Customizing labels and hover helps in Process Portal

You can change the labels or the hover help text that are used in the Process Portal user interface to make them more suitable to your users. For example, you might want to change the header that is used on the main pane or the hover help for one of the icon buttons.
- Adding a custom logo to Process Portal

The Process Portal user interface does not contain any company branding. You might, however, want to include a company logo in the Process Portal application that you provide for your users.
