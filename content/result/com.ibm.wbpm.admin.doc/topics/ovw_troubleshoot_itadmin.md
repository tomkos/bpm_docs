- Troubleshooting business process definitions and service flows

In Business Automation Workflow, you can configure lightweight trace specifications to specify the trace information that you want output to the logs. You can subsequently use the logs to help diagnose problems with the processing of business process definitions (BPDs) and service flows. The trace information in the logs can include the execution times of the various steps in a BPD or service engine, such as the time when a BPD or service flow starts and stops and the amount of time that it takes to complete. The trace information can also include a record of the changes to variables throughout the execution of a process. The logged trace information can also help to identify steps that do not meet their performance goals (such as service invocations) and reduce or eliminate the need to add custom application-level logging to process applications.
