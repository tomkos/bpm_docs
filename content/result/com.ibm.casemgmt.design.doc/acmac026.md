# Defining and modifying project areas by using the command line

## About this task

Each development environment requires a default project
area that is named dev\_env\_connection\_definition. However, you can
define more project areas as needed. Because you might have multiple
people working in the development environment on multiple projects,
you can define project areas to limit the effects of resetting the
test environment. When you reset the test environment from Case Builder, only a single project
area is reset. The entire object store is not affected, and other
users can continue working without interruption.

- Defining a project area by using the command line

You use project areas to limit the effects of resetting the test environment. You can define new project areas or define a default project area if you did not run the Define the Default Project Area task when you configured IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow.
- Adding users to a project area by using the command line

You can add users to a project area or to the default project area. Users cannot log in to Case Builder until they are added to a project area.
- Adding solutions to a project area by using the command line

You can add solutions to a project area or to the default project area. A solution can belong to only one project area.
