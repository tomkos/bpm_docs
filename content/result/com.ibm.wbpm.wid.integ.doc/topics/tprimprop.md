# Mediation primitives and nodes

Tip: Wire the input and output terminals of a mediation
primitive before you set its properties. This will make your input
and output message types known to the editor, and will save you time
when setting the properties.

The properties to be stored in the message context are specified in the details page of the input node's properties view. These properties can be accessed by mediation primitives later in the flow.                                                                                                                                                                               |

It returns the processed message as a response to the source operation. In a request flow, you can use the input response in certain conditional situations. For example if an input error detected, the message can return immediately to the source without invoking the callout.                                                                                            |

There is a callout node for each connected target operation in the mediation flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It forwards the message received from the target operation into the response flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

It returns a fault message as a response to the source operation. In a request flow, you can use the fault response in certain conditional situations. For example if an input error is detected, a fault message can be returned immediately to the source without invoking the callout. A fault response node has an input terminal for each fault defined on the operation. |
|                   | Callout Fault                                                                   | The callout fault node is an end point in the  response flow. When a WSDL fault occurs in the invoked operation, the callout fault propagates the fault message to the primitive or node to which it is wired. The callout fault has an output terminal for each fault message type defined in the target operation.                                                                                                                                      |

- Input

The Input node is the entry point to the request flow. Input propagates the message to the primitive or node to which it is wired. The properties to be stored in the message context are specified in the details page of the input node's properties view. These context properties can be accessed by mediation primitives later in the flow.
- Callout

The callout receives the message and invokes the requested service and operation. There is a callout node for each connected target operation in the mediation flow.
- Input Response

The input response node is an end point in the request and response flows. It returns the processed message as a response to the source operation. In a request flow, you can use the input response in certain conditional situations. For example if an input error is detected, the message can return immediately to the source without invoking the callout.
- Callout response

 The callout response node is a starting point for the response flow. It forwards the message received from the target operation into the response flow.
- Callout Fault

The callout fault node is an end point in the  response flow. When a WSDL fault occurs in the invoked operation, the callout fault propagates the fault message to the primitive or node to which it is wired. The callout fault has an output terminal for each fault message type defined in the target operation.
- Input Fault

The input fault node is an end point in the request and response flows. It returns a fault message as a response to the source operation. In a request flow, you can use the fault response in certain conditional situations. For example if an input error is detected, a fault message can be returned immediately to the source without invoking the callout. A fault response node has an input terminal for each fault defined on the operation.
- Example: Database Lookup mediation primitive

The Database Lookup primitive searches values from a database and stores them in the message. This example shows you how to use the Database Lookup primitive in the Mediation Flow editor.
