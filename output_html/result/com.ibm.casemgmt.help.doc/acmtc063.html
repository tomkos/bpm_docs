<h1>The file does not open when you click a link to a .zip file in a case package</h1>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<p>The
following note under Add an attachment explains the problem: If you attach EXE, VBS, or
ZIP file formats, Acrobat warns you that it wonâ€™t open the file once attached because the format is
associated with malicious programs, macros, and viruses that can damage your
computer.</p>

<h2>Resolving the problem</h2>

<ul>
<li>Open the zip file directly. The zip file is included as part of the Case Package and can be
opened directly.</li>
<li>Use Google Chrome browser to open the PDF. The Chrome browser opens the .zip file when you click
the link.</li>
</ul>
