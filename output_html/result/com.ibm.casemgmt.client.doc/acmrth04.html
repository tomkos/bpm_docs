<h1>Search tips for cases</h1>

<h2>Basic search</h2>

<p>For the basic search, select the case property that you want to search on. For a simple property,
you then enter the value to be searched for.</p>

<p>For a structured property, which is a collection of properties, you can search for a single value
of a property within that collection. After you select the structured property, a second drop-down
list is displayed so that you can select the specific property within the collection. Then you enter
the specific value of that property that you want to search for.</p>

<h2>Advanced search</h2>

<p>You can use the advance search to search based on complex criteria.</p>

<p>Depending on how your environment is configured, the search criteria might be case-sensitive.</p>
