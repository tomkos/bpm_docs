<h1>Enabling access to case solutions in the IBM Content</h1>

<p>Navigator desktop with
Cases feature</p>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>Previously, Case Client
displayed all the solutions that are deployed. The IBM Content
Navigator desktop with
Cases feature now displays a list of all the deployed solutions. You can choose the
solution to be accessed from the Case Client.</p>

<ul>
<li>When you create a new desktop for the Cases feature configuration to be
available, you need to select and save the authentication repository. Else a warning message
appears.</li>
<li>You cannot edit other desktop configurations from a particular desktop, where the
Case Client
plugin is not enabled. You can edit the configurations from that respective desktop or from
the Admin desktop only.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To select the solutions to be accessed from the IBM Content
Navigator
desktop:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to IBM Content
Navigator as an
administrator.
Enter the following URL in a browser:
http://server:port/navigator
server

Navigator
server name or IP address.
port is the IBM Content
Navigator port
number.</li>
<li>Navigate to the desktop with the Cases feature enabled. For example,  Desktops &gt; IBM Business Automation
Workflow &gt; General.</li>
<li>Then, from the Layout tab, select the features that you want to access
for the IBM Content
Navigator desktop. For Cases feature, a configuration section appears with the
Displayed solutions. You can select the solutions to be accessed and clear
the checkbox for any that you do not want to be accessed for the desktop.</li>
