# Auditing process data in Process Portal

## Before you begin

- You can audit process data only when autotracking is enabled for
a business process definition (BPD). If tracking groups are defined
but autotracking is not enabled, you cannot audit process data.
- You can audit only those variables that have been configured for
tracking in Process Designer.
The tracking definitions must also be available in Business Performance
Data Warehouse.
- You must have the appropriate authorization to audit process data.
Auditing process data is limited to the security groups that are specified
for the ACTION\_VIEW\_PROCESS\_AUDIT action
in the WebSphereÂ® Application
Server configuration
files.

## Procedure

1. In the Work dashboard, click the task
icon, and select View Audit History from the
list of actions.
2. Select the business variables that you are interested in
from the list.
