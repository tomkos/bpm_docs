# Icons and symbols for the integration debugger

For example, in the Variables view of the Debug perspective, you
can show the type names of variables by clicking the Show Type Names icon . However, you cannot perform any action by clicking the process variable
symbol .

The icons and symbols used in the integration
debugger are primarily found in the following views of the Debug perspective:

- Debug view
- Component editors
- Breakpoints view
- Variables view

The icons and symbols found in these views are described in the following
sections.

## Debug view

debugger icons and symbols that are used in the Debug view.
