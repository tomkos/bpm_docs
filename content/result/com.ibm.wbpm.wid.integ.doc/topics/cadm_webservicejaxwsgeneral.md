# Working with web service (JAX-WS) bindings

- Importing SAML policy sets

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based OASIS standard for exchanging user identity and security attributes information. When you configure a web service (JAX-WS) binding in Integration Designer, you can specify an SAML policy set. You first use the administrative console of IBMÂ® Integration Designer to make the SAML policy sets available so that they can be imported into Integration Designer.
- Invoking web services that require HTTP basic authentication

HTTP basic authentication employs a user name and password to authenticate a service client to a secure endpoint. You can set up HTTP basic authentication when sending or receiving web service requests.
- Checking the server configuration

When you deploy an application with a web service (JAX-WS) binding, you must make sure that the server on which the application is deployed does not have the Start components as needed option selected.
