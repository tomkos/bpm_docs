# Traditional:Â 
Configuring
VMM and IBM Business Automation Workflow for
optimized group membership synchronization

## About this task

For optimized group membership synchronization, check whether the attached LDAP directories
expose for a group entry an attribute that lists all direct or indirect user members. For example,
you can configure IBM Security Directory
Suite (formerly
IBM Tivoli Directory Server) to expose for a group entry the ibm-allmembers
attribute. This attribute can be queried directly to retrieve all user members of the group. If such
an attribute exists, consider using the second procedure, configuring Business Automation Workflow and VMM by using a group membership property
that reflects all users in a group.
