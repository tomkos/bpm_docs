applications

## About this task

## Procedure

To copy a case solution or create a solution from a template and copy its associated
process application:

1. In Workflow Center, clone the snapshot of the process application that is associated with the solution or solution template.
2. Change the name of the cloned process application to match the name of the new solution.
3. Create a snapshot of the cloned process application.
4. Install the snapshot on Workflow Server or activate the snapshot
on the Workflow Center server.
5. Copy the solution package by using the Case administration client or by using Case Builder.
When you copy the solution, the solution definition file is automatically updated. Important: If you copy the solution first, you must open and save the copied solution after
you clone and create the snapshot of
the process application
to update the solution definition file.
6. Deploy the solution.
