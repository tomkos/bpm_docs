## A

1. A business process that is generated in response to the processing of an event or a rule.
2. An activity that is run on a transition or a transaction.
3. A series of processing steps, such as document validation and transformation.

1. A rule in which the action is always performed. See also if-then
rule, rule set.
2. A business rule that can be edited in the rule editor. Action rules, decision tables, and
decision trees are different representations of business rules.

1. In Eclipse, a group of commands that a perspective contributes to the main toolbar and menu
bar.
2. The leaf of a branch in a decision tree. Action sets consist of one or more actions to be
carried out when the conditions defined in the rule are met.

1. Work that a company or organization performs using business processes. An activity can be atomic
or non-atomic (compound). The types of activities that are a part of a process model are process,
subprocess, and task.
2. Work performed by a user or system, such as within a BPMN process, BPEL process, or case. An
activity can be atomic or non-atomic (compound).

1. A component that contains the business logic that is applied to incoming events, and that is
usually bound to an entity. See also Java agent, rule agent.
2. A process that performs an action on behalf of a user or other program without user intervention
or on a regular schedule, and reports the results back to the user or program.

1. Persistent storage used for long-term information retention, typically very inexpensive for each
stored unit and slow to access, and often in a different geographic location to protect against
equipment failures and natural disasters.
2. To copy programs, data, or files to another storage media, usually for long-term storage or
security.

1. See Application Response Measurement.
2. See automatic restart manager.

1. An entity that is used or produced by a software or systems development process. Examples of
artifacts include designs, requirements, source files, plans, scripts, simulations, models, test
plans, and binary executable files. In an HTTP context, artifacts have a URI and are called
resources.
2. A graphical object that provides supporting information about the process or elements within the
process without directly affecting the semantics of the process.

association is represented as a dotted graphical line with an arrowhead to represent the direction

from a branch node. All transitions created from a branch must have a condition, except the Else
transition.

objects. An example of a business object model is the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) component
model.

conditions or dependencies. An example of a business rule for a bank is that a credit check is not
required when opening an account for an existing customer.

## C
