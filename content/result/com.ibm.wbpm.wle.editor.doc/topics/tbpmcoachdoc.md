Optionally, you can specify the properties that you want to display by configuring the

any of the following document properties:

- Doc name (clickable)
- Doc name
- Type (file or URL)
- File name
- Version label
- Last modified by

You can also specify filter criteria by adding property name/value pairs to the
Filter configuration option and defining the match rule.
