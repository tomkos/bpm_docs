# Installing fix packs and interim fixes

## Before you begin

Visit the IBM
Support website to check for available fix packs and interim
fixes.

## Procedure

Before you install a fix pack or interim fix, perform
the following tasks:

1. Read the fix pack and interim fix documentation thoroughly.
The documentation lists dependencies, such as WebSphereÂ® Application Server fix pack levels
or other IBM product fixes that
you must install before you apply the fix pack or interim fix.
2. To ensure that your implementation is performing the same
way that it did before you applied the fix pack or interim fix, prepare
a regression test plan.
3. Back up your databases and profiles.
4. Before you deploy the fix pack or interim fix to a production
environment, install the fix pack or interim fix in a development
or quality-assurance environment.
