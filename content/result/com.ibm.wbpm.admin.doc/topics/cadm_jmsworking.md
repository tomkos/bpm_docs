# Administering JMS
bindings

Use the administrative console to configure and administer
JMS
import and export bindings.

For detailed
instructions on generating JMS
imports and exports, see Generating a JMS import binding and Generating
a JMS export binding in the Integration Designer information
center.

- Viewing and updating JMS bindings

You can configure JMS import and export bindings to apply special features of the resource. The administrative tasks are performed using the WebSphereÂ® administrative console.
- Properties of JMS bindings

The JMS import and export bindings can be installed with all the necessary connection factories having been created during deployment, or they can be configured to point to a set of existing resources.
- Viewing or changing the state of an endpoint

You can use the administrative console to manage the state of endpoints associated with JMS bindings, WebSphere MQ JMS bindings, and WebSphere MQ bindings. For example, you can pause or resume an endpoint associated with one of those bindings.
