<h1>Managing access to cases through roles and case teams</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<ul>
<li>Managing roles</li>
<li>Managing case teams</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managing roles</h2>

<p>To access a solution, a user must be a member of a role that is associated with that
solution. If you have the correct permission, you can add users and groups to a role by using the
Manage Roles action.</p>

<h3>About this task</h3>

<p>Each solution has one or more roles that are associated with it. Your role determines the tasks
that you can perform and the resources that you can access.</p>

<p>The Manage Roles action is enabled if you have permission to add users and
groups to roles. If you are not a member of any role in a solution, the Manage
Roles action is an option in the Solution and Roles list. If you
are in a solution, the Manage Roles action is included as a toolbar button.
By default, the Manage Roles button is included in the toolbar on the
Work page, which displays your in-basket.</p>

<p>If you belong to more than one role and if your solution is configured to allow it, you can
select a role from the toolbar.</p>

<p>You can press Alt+R to display a dialog box that identifies the currently selected solution and
role. If you are not a member of any solution role, the Role field indicates
that no role is selected.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>To add users or groups to a role:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the Manage Roles action or button.</li>
<li>Select a role for which you want to change the membership and click Add
Members.
If you are looking for a role that is not listed, ask your business analyst whether a new role
can be added.</li>
<li>Search a selected domain for users or groups.</li>
<li>Select users and groups to move them to the role membership.
If you do not see expected users or groups, contact your IT administrator to ask whether you
are using the correct domain. The IT administrator might need to add users and groups to the
system.</li>
<li>Click OK in both windows to save your changes. 
Tip: You can also manage roles from the case management solution. For more information,
see Adding and selecting roles.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Managing case teams</h2>

<p>To access a case that has an assigned team, a user must be a member of that team. If you
are assigned as an owner of the team, you can add case members and owners by using the
Manage Team action.</p>

<h3>About this task</h3>

<p>If a case is configured to support a team, the Manage Team button appears
on the Case Details page.</p>

<p>If you are creating the team for a case, you are automatically added as an owner of that case
team. As an owner, you cannot delete yourself from the list of owners. Another case owner must
delete you from the list.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>To add members and owners to a case team:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the Manage Team action or button.</li>
<li>Select a role in the Roles pane.</li>
<li>Select a user from the Available list and click the
Add icon to add the user as a team member. Alternatively, click
Make Owner to make the selected user a team owner.</li>
</ol>

<p>The available users are those people who are assigned to the selected role in the solution.</p>
