# Deleting components

If you choose to delete a component in the assembly editor
and a component implementation exists for the component, you can delete
the associated component implementation.

## Procedure

To delete components, complete the following steps:

1. In the assembly editor, right-click the component that
you want to delete and click Delete.
2. If a component implementation exists for the component,
a Confirm Delete window opens, in which you can also delete the
component implementation. If you want to delete the component implementation
that is associated with the component, select the check box in the
window and click Yes.  Tip: If any other
components use the same component implementation as the component
that you want to delete, the names of the components show in the text
of the check box.
