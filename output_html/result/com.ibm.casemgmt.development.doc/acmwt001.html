<h1>Tips for sizing workflow widgets</h1>

<p>When you configure the widgets for your Case Client application,
be aware of the following tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the height of the Case List widget to 100% or to a specific pixel
value for Cases in Solution Pages. If you leave the
height as an automatic setting, users are not able to access overflow search results.</li>
<li>When you define the height of the Case Information widget in pixels, be
sure to specify a smaller value than the height of the region. Otherwise, users encounter difficulty
when they try to scroll.</li>
<li>You might encounter unexpected behavior when you change a Choice property to
a radio button set. If you change the Group alignment setting to
Horizontal, the width of the property can retain the width of the original
choice property. This causes some of the radio buttons to shift to a second line instead of using
the width of the container. To resolve this issue, change the Field width
setting to accommodate the width of your radio button set.</li>
<li>You might encounter unexpected behavior when you try to change the width of a property. After
you enter a value for the Width setting, you should be able to save the
change. However, the Save button is not always enabled after you enter a
value. To resolve this issue, use the Tab key to tab out of the field. This action enables the
Save button, and it enables you to save the change.</li>
</ul>
