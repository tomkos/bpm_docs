<li><p>Retrieve a list of the activities of a case</p></li>
<li>Start manual activities</li>
<li>Enable and disable activities</li>
<li>Stop and restart the workflow associated with an activity</li>
<li><p>Create discretionary activities</p></li>

</ul>

<p>To develop case management applications with the workflow Java API, you must configure your system to use both the workflow Java API and the Content Platform Engine Java API.
- Configuring your environment to use the Content Platform Engine Java API</p>

<p>To develop case management applications with the workflow Java API, you must configure your system to use the Content Platform Engine Java API.
- Java API Components</p>

<p>The Java API is organized into a set of major components that you use to build an application.
- Example: Java API Context</p>

<p>With the correct context, a UserContext can be established in the calling thread before calling IBMÂ® Case Manager Java API methods or directly calling Content Platform Engine Java API methods.
