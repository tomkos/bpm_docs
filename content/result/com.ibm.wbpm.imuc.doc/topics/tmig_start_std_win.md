## Procedure

1 Start the target deployment environment:
    1. Start the deployment manager.
    2. Start the nodes and make sure that they are synchronized
with the deployment manager. Important: If
you have an environment with the Business Space component (for Heritage Process Portal) installed
on multiple managed nodes in a cell, start only one node first and
start the other nodes only after the first node has already started.
    3. Start the clusters.
2. Check to make sure that all clusters,
servers, and messaging engines have started.
