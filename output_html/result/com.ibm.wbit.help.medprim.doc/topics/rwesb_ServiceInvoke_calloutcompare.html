<h1>Comparison of Service Invoke and callout</h1>

<h2>Comparing</h2>

<p>the Service
Invoke and the callout</p>

<p>Figure 1. How Service Invoke terminals map to callout
terminals</p>

<!-- image -->

<ul>
<li>The in terminal of
the Service Invoke corresponds
to the in terminal of the callout.</li>
<li>The out terminal
of the Service Invoke
corresponds to the out terminal of the callout
response.</li>
<li>The fail terminal of the
Service Invoke
corresponds to the fail terminal of the callout
response (for an unmodeled fault).</li>
<li><p>A modeled fault output
terminal of the Service Invoke, corresponds
to a modeled fault terminal of the callout fault.</p></li>
<li><p>The Service Invoke mediation primitive does
not switch from request
flow to response flow.</p></li>
<li>The Service Invoke mediation primitive
does not modify either
the transient context or the correlation context.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage considerations</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you need to call a service and return the response,
consider
using the Service Invoke mediation primitive.</li>
<li>If you need
to interact with multiple services, and produce output
that combines service responses, consider using multiple Service Invoke
mediation primitives. In this type of configuration a callout node
might not be necessary; you might be able to configure all the Service
Invoke mediation primitives in the request flow.</li>
<li>If you need
to call an intermediate service, you can use a Service
Invoke mediation primitive. For example, you might use an intermediate
service to adjust a message, or validate a message externally. The
mediation flow would contain a Service Invoke mediation primitive
and a callout to the final service provider.</li>
<li>If you need to
mediate a message (without calling an intermediate
service) and then call a service provider, the use of a callout is
appropriate. The callout provides the simplest model for this configuration.</li>
</ul>
