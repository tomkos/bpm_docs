| Creating snapshots                     | Create snapshots for process applications or toolkits.When you create a snapshot, an acronym is automatically generated for the snapshot. The acronym is used to differentiate multiple versions of the snapshot. For more information, see Naming conventions.                                                                                       | You must have one of the following permissions: Administrative privileges (for example, you are a member of the administrative group tw\_admins) Write permission for the process application or toolkit                                                                                                                                                                | Process Designer or Workflow Center |
| Comparing snapshots                    | Determine the changes that occurred between two snapshots of a process application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | You have read permission for the process application or toolkit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Workflow Center                     |
| Setting status for snapshots           | The following status values are available by default for process application snapshots: New Rejected Validated  Released    The following status values are available by default for toolkit snapshots:  New Rejected Released   Released allows the toolkit snapshot to be visible to a registered remote Process Designer if the toolkit is shared. | You must have one of the following permissions: Administrative privileges (for example, you are a member of the administrative group tw\_admins) Write permission for the process application or toolkit                                                                                                                                                                | Workflow Center                     |
| Viewing validation errors and warnings | View the validation errors and warnings in a snapshot of a process application or toolkit to ensure that it is free of errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | To view the errors in Workflow Center, you must have read permission for a process application or toolkit . But, to view and fix the error in Process Designer, you must have one of the following privileges: Administrative privileges (for example, you are a member of the administrative group tw\_admins) Write permission for the process application or toolkit | Workflow Center                     |
| Viewing the last changed value         | View the latest change in a process application, such as changing the description and creating new versions. This does not apply to the artifacts in a process application.                                                                                                                                                                           | You have read permission for the process application or toolkit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Process Center console              |
