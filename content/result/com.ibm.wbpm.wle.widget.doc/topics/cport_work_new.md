# Completing work on tasks in the Work dashboard

## Task list refresh behavior

To display the latest task updates, task lists in Process Portal are automatically refreshed without user
interaction. Depending on how Process Portal is
configured, the behavior of the task list refresh may vary. By default, your list of tasks is
automatically refreshed in the following situations:

- New tasks are added to the list.
- A task that is assigned to your team is claimed.
- The due date of a task is changed.

## Working with tasks

To see more information about a task, such as the data relevant to the task, click the task icon.
If the task can be completed directly from the Work dashboard, this information
is displayed too. To complete the work on all other tasks, open a task by clicking the task
name.

When you open a task that is assigned to a team, you can claim it. By default, you receive a
confirmation message that the task is assigned to you. You can turn off these messages from the
confirmation window or by changing your user preferences. If you claim a task by mistake, you can
reassign it back to the designated team.

| Details | Provides information about the process instance that the task belongs to. The information includes business data, for example, the customer name, a link to the process instance details, a list of the completed tasks, and the tasks that are in progress. You can follow the process instance from this tab. If you are authorized, you can also act on the process instance by clicking the instance name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Experts | Shows the experts that are defined for the task that you are working on. You can directly interact with the people shown here so that you can complete your work more efficiently. An expert can be either an experienced user or a subject matter expert. Depending on how Process Portal is set up, you might not see an Experienced Users section. Experienced users Experienced users are selected by the system based on the number of tasks of the same type that they previously completed. For example, at the time you opened the Experts tab, the system found three users who previously completed one or more of the same task type, such as the Loan-Approve-or-Reject task, within the same process, such as the Loan-Approval process. The list is empty when the system cannot find any users who previously completed this task type. Subject matter experts Subject matter experts are designated by your team and manually defined in the system for specific task types. If this feature is not configured on your system, the list is empty. |
| Stream  | Shows the activity on the process instance, such as when a task was claimed, or completed; and the posted comments on the instance or the tasks that belong to it. You can post new comments here on the instance or on the task that you are working on. For the task started and claimed stream entries, the time stamp indicates when the task was started or claimed; the assigned group or user is the currently assigned task owner rather than the task owner when the task was started or claimed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
