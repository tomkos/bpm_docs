# Using templates in your decision table

## About this task

Decision tables, in which the conditions or actions are
based on templates are dynamically modifiable in the runtime environment.

you want to give your business analyst the ability to modify the runtime
behavior of the decision table without involving the integration developer.

## Procedure

1. In the decision table, click a cell for either an action
or a condition value.
2. Click the General tab in the properties
area.
3. In the first cell of the Active Template table, click None,
and choose an existing template from the list.
