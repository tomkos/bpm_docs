# Selecting matches

## About this task

You can now select the options that you require:

## Procedure

1. Select a row in the Transform Outputs column that you want to change. Selecting a folder tree node results in the entire tree branch being selected or not selected.
2. Click Edit to start the Transform Inputs window.
3. To select a transform output, select the appropriate tree node check box. Conversely, to remove a transform output, clear the appropriate tree node check box.
4. Ensure that you have selected only the number of matches that you require. The third column displays the number of inputs selected for each transform output. The cell has a value greater than one when the input of a map contains several elements of certain names under various containers, and the input names match to the same output name.
5 Click Finish to complete the mapping process, or click Back to change the matches that you have set up. When you click Finish , you obtain a warning message if either, or both, of the following conditions apply:
    1. More than a few inputs to map to the same output.
    2. Many outputs for which you want to create transforms.
