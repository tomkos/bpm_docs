# Archiving snapshots

## Before you begin

## About this task

When a named snapshot that was created from the tip is archived, and they have
the exact same content, the two snapshots are still associated through a common ID. Because of this
association, the tip artifacts also can't run. However, as soon as you change the tip, it
disassociates from the archived snapshot, and the tip artifacts run independently again.

## Procedure

To archive a snapshot in the classic Workflow Center, complete the following steps:

1. Select the Process Apps or Toolkits tab.
2. Select the project or toolkit you want to archive snapshots for.
If multiple branches exist, select the branch you want from the drop-down menu.
3. Find the snapshot that you want, and then click Archive from
its pop-up menu ().
4. When prompted, click Archive to
confirm your selection.

## Results

To view or restore archived snapshots, click the
Archived filter.
