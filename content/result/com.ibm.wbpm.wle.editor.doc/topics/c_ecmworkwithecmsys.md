# Integrating with Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems

ECM systems manage documents of different types such as records, images, and web pages throughout
their lifecycle. ECM systems are used to increase efficiency and to monitor the security of
information, and comply with industry and government regulations. You can access and update these
documents from a business process by using ECM operations in services such as an integration service
or human service.

For ECM integration, there are predefined types and services that you can use. These types and
services are contained in the Content Management (SYSCM) toolkit.

- Adding an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) server

You need at least one Enterprise Content Management (ECM) server for the service that you develop. You specify the connection properties to access an ECM server on the Process App Settings Servers page for a process application. You can also specify them on the Toolkit Settings Servers page for a toolkit. Adding the server to the Toolkit Settings Servers page allows the connection properties to be reused.
- Outbound interactions with Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems

You can implement queries and services that interact with ECM servers.
- Inbound events from Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems

You can create event subscriptions and design business processes and services that detect and respond to inbound content events from Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems. The content events are used to catch and throw interactions with an ECM system. Business processes can instantiate, continue, or end based on the type of content event, such as the creation, modification, or deletion of a document.
- Troubleshooting interactions with Enterprise Content Management systems

From time to time, you might encounter some issues during interactions with Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems. In most situations, you can successfully work around these issues.
- Integration considerations for ECM products

To work with specific Enterprise Content Management (ECM) products, it is helpful to have an understanding of their main integration considerations, such as their Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) capabilities and limitations.
