# Creating new projects

The first step in developing an application is to set up
one or more projects.

## About this task

## Procedure

1. In the Business Integration view, click File > New.
At the beginning of the long list of things that you can
create, you can see a list of the project types that IBM® Integration
Designer supports:
2. Select a project type. If you want to create a Java™ project or some other type not on the list,
click Project.
3. In the New Project wizard, provide a name for your project.
4. Optional: The Location field shows
where the project files will be saved. Clear the Use default
location check box if you want to name another location
for the project.
5. Optional: Add dependencies on libraries. If libraries exist
in the workspace, a wizard page is available to support this step.
6. If you are creating a mediation module, indicate which
runtime environment you want to use for deployment.
7. Click Finish.
