## Ajax service

In the desktop Process Designer, you
use an Ajax service when you want a coach view to send data to or
retrieve data from the server asynchronously, such as for auto-completion
in text fields, for default selection values in selection lists, and
so forth. When you convert an Ajax service, a corresponding service
flow is created, with an equivalent artifact for each component.

The
following table shows the mapping between the Ajax services in the
desktop Process Designer and
their equivalent service flow artifacts in the Process Designer after
conversion.

## Integration service

In
the desktop Process Designer,
you use an Integration service for outbound integration with web services,
Java and ECM content. When you convert an Integration service, an
equivalent service flow is created, with a service task for each integration
component. For web services and Java integration, external services
are created to provide an interface that the service task can call.

The
following table shows the mapping between the Integration service
artifacts in the desktop Process Designer and
their equivalent artifacts in the Process Designer after
conversion.

## General System service

In
the desktop Process Designer,
you use a General System service to orchestrate other background services,
manipulate variable data, generate HTML for a coach, or perform some
other actions that do not require any integrations or business rules.
When you convert a General System service, a corresponding service
flow is created, with an equivalent artifact for each component.

The
following table shows the mapping between the General System services
in the desktop Process Designer and
their equivalent service flow artifacts in the Process Designer after
conversion.

## Decision service

Decision
services use business rules to determine which process implementation
is invoked. When you convert a Decision service, a service flow is
created with corresponding artifacts. For example, the Decision Table
component is converted into a Script activity and a BAL Rule is converted
to a Decision Task. However, no equivalent artifacts are available
for a JRules Decision Service. Unsupported components are converted
into placeholder artifacts. To complete the service, you must implement
these placeholder artifacts.

The following table shows the
mapping between the Decision service artifacts in the desktop Process Designer and
their equivalent artifacts in the Process Designer after
conversion.

## Deployment
service

In the desktop Process Designer,
you use a Deployment service to customize snapshot installation on
a workflow server in another environment. When you convert a Deployment
service, an equivalent service flow is created, with an equivalent
artifact for each component. A deployment service flow is created
by default when you create a new process application and is used when
you install a snapshot.

For a mapping of Deployment service
artifacts in the desktop Process Designer and
their equivalent artifacts in the Process Designer after
conversion, refer to the Integration service mapping as it is a similar
mapping.
