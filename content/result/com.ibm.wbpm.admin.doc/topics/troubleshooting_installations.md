# Troubleshooting snapshot installations

- Application states for advanced process applications

It is important to understand the differences between the installed and deployed application states when working with advanced process applications, which are process applications created in IBMÂ® Integration Designer.
- Snapshot installation process

Understanding the individual steps in the installation process can help you identify and resolve any errors that occur during snapshot installation.
- Recovering from common snapshot installation errors

If you have problems when installing a snapshot, always check the SystemOut.log and SystemErr.log files for information.
- Preventing timeout and out-of-memory exceptions during installation or deployment

Because Advanced Integration services can increase the size of a process application or toolkit, snapshot installation might fail with a timeout or out-of-memory exception.
