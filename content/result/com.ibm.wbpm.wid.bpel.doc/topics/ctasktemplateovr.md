# Task templates

You can model to-do or collaboration tasks at run time by creating
instances of the com.ibm.task.api.TaskModel class.
You can then use these instances to either create a reusable task
template, or directly create a run-once task instance. Modeling human
tasks at run time is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).
