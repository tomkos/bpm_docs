# Splitting and joining an activity route

## About this task

## Procedure

To create splits and joins for step routes:

1. Create and name the split step.
2. Add one or more responses to the step.
For example,
assign Yes and No as
responses for a step that has two alternate routes.
3. Assign the type of split to the step: OR, AND, or AUTO.
4. Add steps as needed.
A branch can contain multiple
steps. You must return from an AND-split with a collector step.
5. Create a connector for the route from the split step to
the next step.
6. In the Connector Properties section,
assign a name and responses for the route.
7. Create and name a collector step for the route for each
join.
8. Assign the type of join for the collector step.
9. Click Validate to validate the steps.
10. Click Save to save the step changes
for the case type.
