- Bidirectional support in Process Designer

Scripts such as Hijri and Hebrew, where the general flow of text proceeds horizontally from right to left, are called "bidirectional" scripts. The attribute "bidirectional" (bidi) is used for scripts, but by association, the languages that use bidirectional scripts are called bidirectional languages. Although bidi text runs in both directions, the right-to-left direction is the norm.
- Contextual support

Business Automation Workflow offers contextual bidi support for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, where the general flow of text proceeds horizontally from right to left.
