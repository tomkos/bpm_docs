# XSLT and XPath functions

In the map editor, you can filter the function set to see only
the version of functions that you want to use, and you can set the
XML map to generate XSLT in the required format.

- Generating business object or XSLT maps

You use Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) and business object maps to manipulate, evaluate, and format data.
- Filtering XSLT and XPath functions

When you first open an XML map, you can view all the available function sets. You set a filter so that you view only the function set that you want to use.
