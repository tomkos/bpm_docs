# Case Tasks List

You can create a quick task using the New Quick Task button.  You can start a
discretionary To-do task using the Add-To-do button.

When the Case Tasks List view is used in the context of the process user task page, the view is
configured based on the parent case, without specifying the case identifier and target object store
name in the viewâ€™s configuration.
