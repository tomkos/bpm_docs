# Managing library items in IBM Process
Designer

IBMÂ® Process
Designer offers several tools
to ensure that you can quickly and easily access items that you work with on a regular basis. You
can move or copy items between existing or new process applications and toolkits. And you can revert
to previous versions of individual library items using snapshots.

You can also open and view snapshots directly in
Process Designer.

Before performing any of the following tasks, first open IBM Process
Designer.

- Tagging library items

To quickly sort and organize library items in your process applications and toolkits, use the tags and tag groups that are available in IBM Process Designer. You can sort library items by type, name, or tag. By default, they are sorted by type.
- Organizing library items in smart folders

You can arrange library items in smart folders for quick and easy access in IBM Process Designer. For example, you can use the predefined smart folders to easily access daily or weekly changed items, favorites, and public items. In addition, you can create custom smart folders to organize library items according to your preferred criteria.
- Copying, duplicating, moving, and reverting library items

In IBM Process Designer, you can copy, duplicate, and move library items in projects, depending on the permissions you have. And you can also revert library items in projects. You can also open and view snapshots directly in Process Designer.
