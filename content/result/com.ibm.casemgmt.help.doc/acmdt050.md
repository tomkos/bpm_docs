# Configuring the in-basket property synchronization settings

## About this task

At
design time, you use Process Designer to save the event update settings
as part of the solution. For solutions that are already deployed,
you use Process Configuration Console to change the settings.

## Procedure

To configure property synchronization settings:

1. In a stand-alone IBM®
FileNet® Process Designer, open the solution
that you want to configure for editing the FileNet P8 activity workflow.
2. Click View Configuration.
3. In the left panel, expand Work Queues, right-click the queue that you
want to configure, and select Queue Properties.
4. On the Data Fields tab, clear the checkbox in the Event Update column for
all properties that you want to disable synchronization for.
5. Commit your changes.
