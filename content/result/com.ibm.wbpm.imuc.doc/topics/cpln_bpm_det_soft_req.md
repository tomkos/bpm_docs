# Assessing your requirements

Several factors determine your software needs. These factors can
be organized into the following categories.

- Product hardware and software requirements, your own system resource
constraints, and the availability of resources to administer and maintain
your system
- Applications to be deployed to the runtime environment, and the
intended use of the configured environment
- Products, and the versions of these products, to install to meet
your requirements

- The terminology as it applies to environment configuration
- The administrative architecture of the product that you will install,
configure, administer, and maintain
- The available configuration options (through supplied patterns)
and how to determine if a pattern addresses your intended use of the
product
- The supported methods of implementation, including an understanding
of the different task flows for installing the product and configuring
the environment

You can use the information in this section to assess and analyze
your current and future requirements to develop an environment to
meet those requirements.

- Process and process application considerations

Your current requirements provide the baseline on which to formulate a plan for streamlining integration of your business components. Your vision for the future of your business can provide a guideline that can help you make decisions as your business grows.
- Resource considerations

Identify your assets to make the best use of your software and hardware resources and to make informed implementation decisions. Assess your current enterprise information system to determine whether you require any additional hardware or software to meet your business needs.
