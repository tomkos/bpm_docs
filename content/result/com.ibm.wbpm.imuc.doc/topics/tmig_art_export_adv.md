# Exporting existing assets from your current version

## About this task

To access Workflow Center, either start the
authoring environment or open your web browser to the following location: http://[host\_name]:[port]/ProcessCenter.
The Workflow Center server must be running.

## Procedure

1. Export existing process applications and toolkits as described in Importing and exporting
process applications from Workflow Center and
Importing and exporting toolkits from Workflow Center in the online
help for your version of the authoring environment.

Important: Export first the toolkits and then the process applications. To preserve the
toolkit versioning order from your current Workflow Center, export them in the
correct order. The last exported toolkit will be the tip in the new Workflow Center.
2. After you have exported all existing assets, exit the authoring
environment or close your browser window.
