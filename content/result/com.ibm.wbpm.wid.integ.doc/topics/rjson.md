# JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format

JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON) is a lightweight data-interchange format. JSON is easy for
humans to read and write. JSON is easy for machines to parse and generate.
JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming
Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a
text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions
that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including
C, C++, C#, Javaâ„¢, JavaScript,
Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal
data-interchange language. More details on the JSON format can be
found at Introducing
JSON.

Note: The property name in the JSON data should
match exactly with the property name in the business object.

## Single cardinality contained business object

Given
the following business object:

And given the following
values for the business object properties:

| Business Object    | Property                                                                               | Value                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer  	Address | firstName lastName streetAddress city state postalCode phoneNumbers[0] phoneNumbers[1] | John Smith 21 2nd Street New York NY 10121 212-732-1234 646-123-4567 |

The JSON format is the following:

```
1	{
2	    "firstName": "John",
3	    "lastName": "Smith",
4	    "address": {
5	        "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",

13	    ]
14	}
```

## Multiple cardinality contained business object

Given
the following business object:

And given the
following values for the business object properties:

| Business Object                      | Property                                                                                                                   | Value                                                                                                     |
