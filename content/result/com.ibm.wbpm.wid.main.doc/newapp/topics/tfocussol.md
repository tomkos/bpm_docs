# Focusing integration solutions in the Business Integration
view

In the Business Integration view, you can choose to focus
a single integration solution and its referenced projects or to display
all integration solutions and their referenced projects. When an integration
solution is focused in the Business Integration view, all other integration
solutions and their referenced projects are hidden.
