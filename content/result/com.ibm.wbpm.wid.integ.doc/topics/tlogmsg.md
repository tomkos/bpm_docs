# Logging messages during a mediation flow

## About this task

By default, the Message Logger logs the body section
of the message. You can configure the Message Logger to log the entire
message, or you can use an XPath expression to specify a part of the
message to be logged.

By default, messages are logged to the
Common database that is created during installation of the server.
You can create your own database and log your messages there. Or,
when you install and configure your runtime product you can specify
which physical database is used as the Common database. For example,
you might define the Common database as being a DB2Â® database.

For more information on the
Message Logger primitive, see the Message Logger mediation primitive
topic in the Reference section.

For information on viewing logged
messages, see the example topic in the Message Logger mediation primitive
Reference.
