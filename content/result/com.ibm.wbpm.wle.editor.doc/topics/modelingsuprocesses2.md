# Modeling non-reusable subprocesses

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Open the parent process.
2. In the Definition page, add a subprocess to the diagram and name the subprocess. 
Note: Swimlanes that you add to your subprocess are independent. They are not part of the swimlanes
that are contained in the parent process.
3. Double-click the subprocess activity to open the subprocess and model the diagram.
4. Subprocesses have access to all of the variables that are defined in the parent process.
You do not need to map data to pass data into or out of the subprocess. However, you can declare
variables that are available only to the subprocess (and any subprocesses it contains). See Modeling subprocess data.
5. Like other activities, you can configure your subprocess to run the subprocess steps
multiple times. Select the subprocess activity in the parent process and set the repeating behavior
in the General tab.
6. Click Save or Finish
Editing.
