# Contacting IBM Software
Support

## Before you begin

To take advantage of unique Support features, see the IBM Business Automation Workflow support
page. The Support Page contains the latest information on fixes and
downloads, educational resources, and commonly encountered problems
and their solutions.

Before contacting IBM Software Support, your company must have
an active IBM software subscription
and support contract, and you must be authorized to submit problems
to IBM. The type of software
subscription and support contract that you need depends on the type
of product you have. For information about the types of software subscription
and support contracts available, see Enhanced Support in the Software
Support Handbook site listed in the Related Topics section.

To
contact IBM Software Support
with a problem, perform the steps in the Procedure section.

## Procedure

1. Define the problem, gather background information, and
determine the severity of the problem. For help, see the Contacting IBM in the Software Support
Handbook.
2. Gather diagnostic information. When explaining
a problem to IBM, be as specific
as possible. Include all relevant background information so that IBM Software Support specialists
can help you solve the problem efficiently. For information that IBM Support needs in order to help
you solve a problem, see the IBM Business Automation Workflow MustGather
technote. You can use the IBM Business Automation Workflow plug-in
for the IBM Support Assistant
to capture the data and send it to IBM. 
Note: If
you are able to determine that the problem is purely with underlying WebSphereÂ® Application Server
functionality, consider requesting assistance specifically from the WebSphere Application Server
Support team rather than the IBM Business Automation Workflow team.
For information that IBM Support
needs in order to help you solve a WebSphere Application
Server problem, see the WebSphere Application
Server MustGather Technote.
3 Submit your problem to IBM SoftwareSupport in one of the following ways:
    - Using IBM Support Assistant:
See the IBM Support Assistant topic.
    - Online: Open a service request on the IBM Software Support site using the Electronic
Service Request (ESR) tool.
    - By telephone: For the telephone number to call in your country
or region, go to the contacts page of the IBM Software Support Handbook on the Web and
click the name of your geographic region.
