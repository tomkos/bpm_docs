# WebSphere
Business Integration Adapters

Each business application requires its own application-specific adapter to participate in the
business integration process. You can install, configure, and test the adapter using current WebSphere Business
Integration Adapter Framework and Development Kit System Manager tools. You can use IBMÂ® Integration
Designer to import existing business objects and
connector configuration files, to generate artifacts, and to assemble the solution for IBM Business Automation Workflow.

Operational commands for the WebSphere Business Integration Adapters are part of the administrative
console.
