# Testing modules

## About this task

- Unit testing

In IBM Integration Designer, you can use the integration test client to unit test your modules. The testing is generally performed on the interface operations of your components, which you can use to determine whether the components are correctly implemented and the references are correctly wired.
- Component testing

The test suite editor and associated wizards allow you to create and define test cases that consist of one or more operations. This enables you to sequentially test multiple operations as a group in the integration test client. You can also perform batch component testing on either a test environment server or a stand-alone server by using test scripts or the user interface of the web-based Component Test Explorer.
