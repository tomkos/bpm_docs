## Interface information

- Customizing display attributes relies on cascading style sheets to render the user interface
correctly. However, the application provides equivalent facilitation if you have reduced vision by
using your system display settings, including high-contrast mode. You can also increase the page
size by using your browser zoom feature.
- Zooming activity details in Mozilla Firefox: Go to the activity. When the activity details
appear, click the window, and then press Ctrl+Plus sign keys (+) to zoom in and
Ctrl+Minus sign keys (-) to zoom out of the diagram.
- If you use JAWS: To complete forms controls: Generally, JAWS automatically changes from the
virtual PC cursor mode to forms mode when it encounters forms controls, such as input tags. If a
control does not respond to the keyboard, press Insert+Z to toggle the virtual PC
cursor mode.
