<h1>Primary queue</h1>

<p>Only role swimlanes that have a primary queue attribute are used in Step Designer. Roles without
a primary queue are ignored and cannot be added to the task process map as a swimlane. If the same
primary queue is mapped to more than one role, Step Designer displays only one of the roles that
matches the primary queue as an option to add as a role swimlane to the task process map.</p>

<p>The value for the primary queue attribute, CB_PrimaryQueue, is the queue name that is defined by
Case Builder when you define a role. The format of the value is
<solution prefix>_<normalized role name>. For example, if you define
role A for a solution that is called My Solution that has the
solution prefix myso, Case Builder defines a
queue name of myso_roleA and sets the value for the CB_PrimaryQueue attribute for
role A as myso_roleA.</p>

<ul>
<li>An upgraded solution contains two or more roles that have their first in-basket (with
CB_Inbasket attribute) and those in-baskets point to the same queue.</li>
<li>You manually set CB_PrimaryQueue for two roles to share the same
queue in IBM
FileNet® Process Designer</li>
</ul>
