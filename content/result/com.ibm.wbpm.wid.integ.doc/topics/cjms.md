# Java Message Service
(JMS)

This section examines the JMS programming model. The section then
shows how a JMS message maps to Service Component Architecture (SCA)
artifacts; that is, how a message maps to a business object and how
input and output from a JMS client maps to an interface's operations.
Data bindings and an important function called the function selector
are discussed. You are then led through the generation of a JMS import
and export binding and presented with some standard applications that
make use of the JMS binding.

- Java Message Service (JMS) programming model

The JMS programming model is discussed in this section.
- JMS features

Several features of JMS bindings and how SCA artifacts work with them are discussed.
- Working with JMS bindings

JMS bindings can be generated for imports and exports with either a one-way operation or request-response operation. All cases are discussed in this section.
- JMS, MQ JMS and generic JMS bindings

The bindings for JMS, MQ JMS and generic JMS are examined.
- Creating applications with JMS bindings

Building applications that use the JMS bindings are shown in this section.
- JMS imports and exports at run time

The sequence of the methods used at run time is discussed.
- Limitations of the JMS, MQ JMS and generic JMS bindings

The JMS and MQ JMS bindings have some limitations.
