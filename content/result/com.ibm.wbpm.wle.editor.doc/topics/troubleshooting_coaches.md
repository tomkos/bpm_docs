If you experience problems running services that include heritage coaches, check for the issues
described in the following table:

| Issue                                                                    | Potential cause and resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Dynamic values are not displayed in a heritage coach as expected.        | You might be using null values in the variable (that is, the variable has no value versus the value 0). When initializing variables in the service that contains the heritage coach, assign default values to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Input values are not captured as expected at run time.                   | This can happen when using multiple sections in a heritage coach. Each section is its own HTML form; submitting data in a section does not submit data in another section, unless it is a nested section. Always design your heritage coaches with this rule in mind.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Unexpected behavior of nested visibility rules at run time.              | An example of nested visibility rules is described in Displaying a control based on the input value of another control in a heritage coach. If possible, design your heritage coaches such that you can distribute the rules across more than one heritage coach. Another option is to use custom JavaScript to express cascading rules. An example is provided in Changing the visibility of a heritage coach control. |
| A configured onClick event for a button does not take place at run time. | Ensure that the onClick event is assigned to the individual button instead of a Button Group control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
