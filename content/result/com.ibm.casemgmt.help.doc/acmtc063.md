# The file does not open when you click a link to a .zip file in a case package

## Symptoms

## Causes

The
following note under Add an attachment explains the problem: If you attach EXE, VBS, or
ZIP file formats, Acrobat warns you that it wonâ€™t open the file once attached because the format is
associated with malicious programs, macros, and viruses that can damage your
computer.

## Resolving the problem

- Open the zip file directly. The zip file is included as part of the Case Package and can be
opened directly.
- Use Google Chrome browser to open the PDF. The Chrome browser opens the .zip file when you click
the link.
