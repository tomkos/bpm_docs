# DB2 for z/OS authorization prerequisites

## User authorization requirements for DB2 for z/OS

Ask
your DB2 for z/OS system administrator to check the authorizations
that have been granted to ensure that you have not granted more authority
than necessary to any user ID. It can be tempting to grant DB2 SYSADM authority to the JCA
authentication aliases in order to avoid possible problems with DB2 security during the configuration.
The WebSphere® administrator
ID should not require more than DBADM authority to create the IBM Business Automation Workflow database
objects.

```
GRANT USE OF STOGROUP   @STOGRP@     TO  @DB\_USER@ WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DBADM ON DATABASE @DB\_NAME@    TO  @DB\_USER@;
GRANT USE OF ALL BUFFERPOOLS         TO  @DB\_USER@;
```

```
GRANT CREATEIN,ALTERIN,DROPIN ON SCHEMA @SCHEMA@ TO @DB\_USER@ WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

```
GRANT CREATE ON COLLECTION @SCHEMA@ TO @DB\_USER@;
GRANT BINDADD TO @DB\_USER@;
```

## Authorization requirements for views on DB2 for z/OS V10 or V11

- Before you run the SQL to define views, you might need to set the DBACRVW subsystem parameter to
YES. This setting ensures that WebSphere
administrator IDs with DBADM authority on database @DB\_NAME@ can create views for
other user
IDs.
- On DB2 for z/OS V10or V11, the WebSphere administrator ID must bespecifically granted access to views, because access is not implicitly granted to users with DBADMauthority on the database. Individual GRANT statements or a Resource Access Control Facility (RACF®) group can be used to provide access to views in DB2 for z/OS V10 or V11.Ask your DB2 for z/OSadministrator to provide this access by using either of the following methods:
    - Issue an explicit GRANT statement for each view. For example, the following sample GRANT
statements can be issued for user ID
WSADMIN:GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.ACTIVITY TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.ACTIVITY\_ATTRIBUTE TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.ACTIVITY\_SERVICE TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.APPLICATION\_COMP TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.AUDIT\_LOG TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;

GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.ESCALATION\_DESC TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.ESC\_TEMPL TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.ESC\_TEMPL\_CPROP TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.ESC\_TEMPL\_DESC TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;

GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.MIGRATION\_FRONT TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.PROCESS\_ATTRIBUTE TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.PROCESS\_INSTANCE TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.PROCESS\_TEMPLATE TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.PROCESS\_TEMPL\_ATTR TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.QUERY\_PROPERTY TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.QUERY\_PROP\_TEMPL TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.SHARED\_WORK\_ITEM TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.TASK TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.TASK\_AUDIT\_LOG TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.TASK\_CPROP TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.TASK\_DESC TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.TASK\_HISTORY TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.TASK\_TEMPL TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.TASK\_TEMPL\_CPROP TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.TASK\_TEMPL\_DESC TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.WORK\_BASKET TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.WORK\_BASKET\_DIST\_TARGET TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.WORK\_BASKET\_LDESC TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE ON TABLE S1CELL.WORK\_ITEM TO WSADMIN WITH GRANT OPTION;
    - Define a RACF group that corresponds to the schema name
for the views, and connect the WebSphere administrator
ID to the RACF group. For example, you can define a RACF group named S1CELL, and connect user WSADMIN to it, as
follows:INFORMATION FOR GROUP S1CELL
	SUPERIOR GROUP=ZWPS 		OWNER=ZWPS 		CREATED=07.144
	INSTALLATION DATA=OWNED BY EMP SERIAL 009179, SITE ABCUK
	NO MODEL DATA SET
	TERMUACC
	NO SUBGROUPS
	USER(S)=		ACCESS=		ACCESS COUNT=		UNIVERSAL ACCESS=
	  WSADMIN		 CONNECT		 000000 		 NONE
		  CONNECT ATTRIBUTES=NONE 
		  REVOKE DATE=NONE 			RESUME DATE=NONE

## Storage group assignments and buffer pool usage

Ask
your DB2 for z/OS system administrator to check the storage
group assignments and buffer pool usage. Incorrect storage group assignment
and buffer pool usage might not show up as an error message in a log,
but might cause problems later. It is better to resolve such problems
now rather than when the system has been handed over for use. For
example, correcting storage groups and VCATs is not easy after the
tables and indexes have been used.
