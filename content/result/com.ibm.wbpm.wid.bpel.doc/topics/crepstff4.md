# Replacement variables in staff emails

- Using percent signs within variable names is not allowed.
- If you want to use a percent sign in a string within the replacement
variable, then you will need to use two percent signs ("%%") instead
of one.
- Variables can contain XPath expressions. If an XPath expression
contains a "%" sign, it must be escaped as specified by XML (using &#37;).

| Type of variable       | Expression                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
