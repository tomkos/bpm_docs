## Determine the business impact of your problem

When
you report a problem to IBM, you are asked to supply a severity
level. Therefore, you need to understand and assess the business impact
of the problem that you are reporting. Use the following criteria:

| Severity level   | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Severity 1       | The problem has a critical business impact: You are unable to use the program, resulting in a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution. |
| Severity 2       | This problem has a significant business impact: The program is usable, but it is severely limited.                                                                          |
| Severity 3       | The problem has some business impact: The program is usable, but less significant features (not critical to operations) are unavailable.                                    |
| Severity 4       | The problem has minimal business impact: The problem causes little impact on operations or a reasonable circumvention to the problem was implemented.                       |

## Describe your problem and gather background information

You
can describe a problem using the general instructions below, but you
will get more help in gathering data by downloading IBM Support
Assistant 4.0. You can read about IBM Support
Assistant and find a link to the download site in the document by
that name. See the related links at the end of this page.

- What software versions were you running when the problem occurred?
- Do you have logs, traces, and messages that are related to the
problem symptoms?
- Can you re-create the problem? If so, what steps do you perform
to re-create the problem?
- Did you make any changes to the system? For example, did you make
changes to the hardware, operating system, networking software, or
other system components?
- Are you currently using a workaround for the problem? If so, be
prepared to describe the workaround when you report the problem.

ways:
