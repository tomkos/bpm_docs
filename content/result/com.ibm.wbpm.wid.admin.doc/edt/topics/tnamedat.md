# Renaming extended data elements in event definitions

In the event definition editor, you can rename any of the
extended data elements in an event definition. If you rename an extended
data element and it has the same name and data type as an extended
data element in the parent event definition (or in any higher-level
parent in the same inheritance hierarchy), then the renamed extended
data element will override the extended data element of the parent.
