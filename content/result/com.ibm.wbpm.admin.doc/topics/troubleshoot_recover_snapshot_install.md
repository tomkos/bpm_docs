# Recovering from common snapshot installation errors

## Procedure

You might receive this
error if you previously opened the process application or toolkit in Integration Designer. Opening a process application or toolkit in
Integration Designer enables advanced content in the process
application; therefore, the process application or toolkit will require an Advanced
deployment environment workflow server to deploy it. Restore the process
application or toolkit to Standard
deployment environment capabilities by
disassociating the modules and libraries that were generated when the process application or toolkit
was opened and then try to install again. For more information, see Disassociating a module or library from a process application or toolkit.

Failures to migrate data or instances
do not cause the installation to fail.
