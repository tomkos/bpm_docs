## Invoke, Scope, and Snippet activities

<!-- image -->

Use
the settings on this page to configure the administrative settings
for an invoke, scope, or snippet activity. With the invoke activity,
these administrative duties include the authority to handle faults
that may arise, or to force retry or force complete long-running activities.

For
the scope activity, these administrative duties include the authority
to modify, at run time, the sequence of the activities nested within
the scope activity. An alternative way to create a business process
logic that allows the user to change the order of activities is to
use a collaboration scope. See related links
for more information on case handling support and enhanced dynamic
behavior.

If there is no existing human task associated, click New to
launch the human task editor to configure one. If there is a human
task associated, then click Open to launch the human task editor
to make any needed modifications to it, or click Remove to
clear the association.

The human task that you associate with
this activity will override the default activity administrative
task setting for this BPEL process.
