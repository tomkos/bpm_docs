# Test Data Table view

The Test Data Table view is shown in the following figure:

- 1 Imports
- 2 Defaults

## Imports

The Imports pane is used to import
Java extension classes or packages. It supports code assist in the
test data table. The Imports page is shown in the following figure:

When you import a Java extension
class or a package, you can specify use them in the Java expressions
for the variables in the test data table.

## Default pane

The Default pane contains the
test data table that is used to specify, view, and edit values for
operations. The values in the test data table can be repeated in variations.
A variation contains a unique set of input values and expected results
and it enables you to run a given test case against them. When a test
case is run, it is run against all of the variations of the test
data table.

The Default pane is shown in the following figure:

- 1 Parameters
- 2 Fields
- 3 Arrays
- 4 Elements
- 5 Fields

The Name column presents a hierarchical
view of the data. Fields of a complex element are nested below the
complex element. Similarly, elements of arrays are nested below the
arrays, and fields are nested below the elements. To add an element
to an array, you need to right-click the array and select Add
Elements.

The Type column
shows the data type of each object.

The In column
accepts and displays the input values specified for an object. And
the Expected column accepts and displays the
values expected as output for an object. If you specify an invalid
value in these columns, the row that contains the invalid value will
be flagged with the validation error symbol . Validation errors do not indicate that you have
errors in your workspace and they do not prevent you from continuing
your testing. You can hover your cursor over the validation error
symbol to obtain additional information about the validation error.
Similarly, if you select the row that contains the validation error,
the status area at the bottom of the test data table will provide
additional information about the error.

Note that at the top
of the test data table, you can use the Go to Previous
Error icon  and the Go
to Next Error icon  to move to
the previous error or the next error.

When the test data table
first opens, the following values are automatically assigned:

- Read-only fields are flagged with the read-only symbol .
- All other fields are populated with default values.

If you are working with large business objects that have many
fields and values, there are numerous features that can help you work
with them more effectively in the test data table, such as:

- A Maximize Editor icon  that enables you to maximize the size of the test
data table.
- Keyboard navigation that lets you navigate the test data table
using common keys like Tab, Page
Up/Down, and the arrow keys.
- Multiple field editing mechanisms.

Field editing mechanisms are discussed more fully in the topic
"Specifying variable values."

## Variable value states

Input values for variables
can exist in one of the following two states:

By comparison, output values for variables can also
exist in one of the following two states:

The states of a variable can be changed by right-clicking
the variable and selecting one of the Set menu
items.

## Pop-up menu items

In the test data table,
you can choose from numerous pop-up menu items to help you manage
the values that you pass to variables. The pop-up menu items that
are available differ depending on the kind of variable for which you
are specifying a value. The following table lists some of the
pop-up menu items that are available in the test data table.

If you want to work with the XML editor, double-click the XML string in the Set or Expected column. The XML editor opens and displays the variable values in XML document format.In the test suite editor, the test data table is the editor that is open by default. If you switch to the XML format, a serialization of the value structure occurs for the purpose of populating the XML editor. When you switch to the XML format strictly for viewing the content and you do not perform any editing or import any file, you can switch back to the literal format if you so choose. However, if you perform any editing or import any file in the XML editor, then switching back to the literal format in the data table will invoke a message that warns you that data may be lost, such as XML comments. |

## Importing values from XML

Values of one business object in the XML
can be imported into a business object with a different data type
in the test data table if the attribute names match. (The one
exception to this rule is that if the top-level root element name
in the XML differs from the top-level parameter name in the test data
table, the top-level root name in the XML will be ignored. And if
the XML resides in a SOAP message file, the SOAP envelope and body
elements are also ignored.)

Some other considerations for importing
values from XML include:

- If a value that you want to import from the XML is not the correct
data type for a corresponding field in the test data table, such as
when importing a boolean value from the XML into an integer field
in the test data table, then an error icon is displayed.
- If no matching attribute name is found in the XML for an attribute
in the test data table, then the attribute field in the value editor
is automatically set to unset.

To better illustrate how importing values from XML works,
assume that the test data table is populated with the following elements:

| Name   | Type          | In   |
|--------|---------------|------|
| order  | PurchaseOrder |      |
| id     | string        |      |
| items  | Item[]        |      |
