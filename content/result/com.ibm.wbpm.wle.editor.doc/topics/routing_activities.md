# Assigning teams to BPD activities (deprecated)

## Before you begin

To perform
this task, you must be in the IBMÂ® Process
Designer desktop
editor, which is deprecated.

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Open the desktop Process Designer (deprecated).
2. Open a process application that contains a business process
definition (BPD).
3. Click an activity in a BPD diagram to display its properties.
4. Go to the Assignments page in the
properties view.
5 From the Assign To list, chooseone of the following options: Table 1. AssignmentOptions Option Description Lane Assigns the runtime task to the team associatedto the swimlane in which the selected activity is located (the defaultselection). If you select this option, you can use a team filter serviceto dynamically eliminate users from being assigned to the activity. Team Assigns the runtime task to a team. If you selectthis option, you can either specify a static team or use a team retrievalservice to dynamically select a suitable set of users. In addition,you can use a team filtering service to remove unsuitable users fromthe team. Routing Policy (Deprecated) Assigns the runtime task according to the policythat you establish. List of Users (Deprecated) Assigns the runtime task to an ad hoc list ofusers. If the list contains only one user, the task is assigned directlyto this user. Custom Assigns the runtime task according to the JavaScript expression that youprovide in the corresponding field. To select a variable for your expression, click the variableselection icon next to the field. The JavaScript expression can produce the following supportedexpression formats: In the above list, user\_name is the name of an Business Automation Workflow user (such as author ) andgroup\_name is the name of an Business Automation Workflow security group (such astw\_authors ), and team\_name is the name of an Business Automation Workflow team. When USER and either TEAM or ROLEare specified in the expression, the task will be assigned to the specified user and either the teamor role. There is no membership validation check for whether the specified user is member of theteam or role. The order of USER, TEAM and ROLE in the expression is notsignificant. Note: Complex JavaScript expressions can be typed in or pasted into theExpression field and can be customized as required. More valid expressionscan be chained together to produce a complex JavaScript expression, for exampletw.local.isWeekendCrew?"ROLE:WeekendManagers":"ROLE:Managers" . Important: To show up in the Team Performancedashboard, tasks must be assigned to a Team or a team Lane. Tasksthat are assigned to the deprecated options are not displayed on theTeam Performance dashboard.

6. Optional: From the Experts Team list,
select the team that you want to associate with the selected activity.
7 If you selected Assign To Team youmust assign a team.

1. To define a new team, click New,
provide a name, and complete the team properties. For more
information about the team properties, see Creating a team.
2. If you want to select an existing team, click Select,
then choose a team from the list.
3. If you want to specify a fixed team name or a team that
is not defined yet, enter the name as a literal value, for example, damageAssessors.
4. If you want the team to be selected by the value of
a local or environment variable, specify the name of the variable,
for example, tw.local.dynamicTeamName.
8 Optional: If you selected AssignTo Team or Assign To Lane the TeamFilter Service section is displayed. If youwant to use a team filter service to eliminate certain users beforethe user distribution is applied, complete the following steps.

1. To assign a Team Filter Service,
either click Select to select an existing team
filter service or click New to define a new
one. If you select New, perform Setting up a team filter service.
2. If the team filter service that you selected or defined
requires parameters from the application, a Team Filter
Service Input Mapping section is displayed. For
each required service variable, enter the corresponding process variable
name, for example tw.local.estimatedClaimAmount or tw.system.user.id.
9 From the User Distribution list,choose one of the following options: Table 2. UserDistribution Option Description None Business Automation Workflow assignsthe runtime task to all potential users (the default setting). Thisoption always applies to assignment options that result in a singleuser for the runtime task assignment, for example, when a list ofusers contains only one user. Last User Applies only to Lane and Team assignment options. Assigns the runtime task to a user who completed an earlier task. In both cases, the task is assigned only to an established last user, if the user is amember of the group associated with the task. An established last user is determined by using thepolicy valid for the Lane or Team assignment option, respectively. If the user is not a member ofthe group associated with the task, then the task is assigned to the task group. Do not selectthe Last User option for the first activity in a lane unless you selected theLane Assignment, the activity is a service in a top-level BPD, and a Start Event is in the lane. Inthis case, the runtime task is routed to the user who started the BPD. Load Balance From the potential users who can receive theruntime task, Business Automation Workflow assignsto the users who have the fewest number of open tasks, regardlessof presence. Round Robin From the potential users who can receive theruntime task, Business Automation Workflow assignsto users in a round-robin fashion. For example, if the users in theCall Center team must receive the runtime task, Business Automation Workflow assignseach task (created by each process instance) in a series - to oneuser in the team after another.By default, the created tasks areassigned in a round-robin fashion only if they are created a few secondsapart and are not created in parallel. However, if tasks are createdin parallel, some of them might sometimes be assigned to the sameuser. To avoid the assignment of consecutive tasks to the sameuser, an optimized round-robin procedure can be used that assignsthe next user ID for tasks created on the same server. The optimizedprocess does not coordinate the user selection between the serverswithin a cluster. To activate the optimized round-robin procedure,add the following setting to the appropriate 100Custom.xml filein your topology: <server> <bpd-engine> <optimize-round-robin-per-server>true</optimize-round-robin-per-server> </bpd-engine> </server> When this setting is not included in the 100Custom.xml file,or it is set to false , then the default round-robinprocedure is applied. Note: Sorting by task ID does not necessarilyreflect the order of the user assignment. Consider the following example:Dueto parallel processing of the BPD engine, several tasks are createdwith the same time stamp. Let us call the created tasks task1, task2,task3, and task4 with task IDs T1, T2, T3, and T4 respectively andusers U1, U2, U3, and U4. During round-robin processing, tasks areassigned to users as task1-U1, task2-U2, task3-U3, task4-U1. However,due to serialization limitations, the task IDs might not be assignedin the same order as the created tasks. Instead, they can be assignedas task1-T1, task2-T3, task3-T4, task4-T2. Now, because the creationdate and time is the same for all tasks, when you sort the data bytask ID, the sorted order is T1(task1)-U1, T2(task4)-U4, T3(task2)-U2,T4(task3)-U3.

| None         | Business Automation Workflow assigns the runtime task to all potential users (the default setting). This option always applies to assignment options that result in a single user for the runtime task assignment, for example, when a list of users contains only one user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Last User    | Applies only to Lane and Team assignment options. Assigns the runtime task to a user who completed an earlier task.  If the assignment option is set to Lane, the task is assigned to the last user associated with the activity that was most recently completed in the same lane. If the assignment option is set to Team, the task is assigned to the user who completed the last task that was assigned to the same team.   In both cases, the task is assigned only to an established last user, if the user is a member of the group associated with the task. An established last user is determined by using the policy valid for the Lane or Team assignment option, respectively. If the user is not a member of the group associated with the task, then the task is assigned to the task group. Do not select the Last User option for the first activity in a lane unless you selected the Lane Assignment, the activity is a service in a top-level BPD, and a Start Event is in the lane.  In this case, the runtime task is routed to the user who started the BPD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Load Balance | From the potential users who can receive the runtime task, Business Automation Workflow assigns to the users who have the fewest number of open tasks, regardless of presence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Round Robin  | From the potential users who can receive the runtime task, Business Automation Workflow assigns to users in a round-robin fashion. For example, if the users in the Call Center team must receive the runtime task, Business Automation Workflow assigns each task (created by each process instance) in a series - to one user in the team after another.By default, the created tasks are assigned in a round-robin fashion only if they are created a few seconds apart and are not created in parallel. However, if tasks are created in parallel, some of them might sometimes be assigned to the same user. To avoid the assignment of consecutive tasks to the same user, an optimized round-robin procedure can be used that assigns the next user ID for tasks created on the same server. The optimized process does not coordinate the user selection between the servers within a cluster. To activate the optimized round-robin procedure, add the following setting to the appropriate 100Custom.xml file in your topology: <server>     <bpd-engine>        <optimize-round-robin-per-server>true</optimize-round-robin-per-server>     </bpd-engine>  </server>When this setting is not included in the 100Custom.xml file, or it is set to false, then the default round-robin procedure is applied.  Note: Sorting by task ID does not necessarily reflect the order of the user assignment. Consider the following example:Due to parallel processing of the BPD engine, several tasks are created with the same time stamp. Let us call the created tasks task1, task2, task3, and task4 with task IDs T1, T2, T3, and T4 respectively and users U1, U2, U3, and U4. During round-robin processing, tasks are assigned to users as task1-U1, task2-U2, task3-U3, task4-U1. However, due to serialization limitations, the task IDs might not be assigned in the same order as the created tasks. Instead, they can be assigned as task1-T1, task2-T3, task3-T4, task4-T2. Now, because the creation date and time is the same for all tasks, when you sort the data by task ID, the sorted order is T1(task1)-U1, T2(task4)-U4, T3(task2)-U2, T4(task3)-U3. |

- Setting up a routing policy (deprecated)

Â Traditional:Â 
One of the options when routing the runtime tasks that are generated by BPD activities, is to establish a routing policy.
- Defining rules with a routing policy (deprecated)

Â Traditional:Â 
When you establish a Routing Policy for a BPD activity, you establish rules to determine the recipients of the activity as a runtime task.
