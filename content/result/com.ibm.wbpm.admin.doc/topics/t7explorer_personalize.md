# Creating personalized views for Business Process Choreographer
Explorer or Business Process Archive Explorer

## About this task

To create personalized views, complete the following steps.

## Procedure

1. In the section of the Views tab navigation
pane, for example, Process Templates, where you want to define the
new view, click the New search icon ().
2. In the Search For ... And Define Customized Views page,
where ... is the type of view, for example Process Templates, select
a query table for your view. A default query table is
set for your view definition. You can either select a different query
table, or choose not to use query tables in your view definition. Note: If
you use a query table, you cannot specify additional search criteria
here for the view. All the search criteria must be defined in the
query table definition.

If you are not using a query
table, specify search criteria. Use the Process Criteria tab,
the Task Criteria tab, and the Property
Filters tab to limit the search results, for example, to
a specific process template. When defining instance views, you can
also use the User Roles tab to limit the search
results to users, groups, or roles.
3. If you are using query tables and the query table definition
has parameters, specify the query parameters that are needed on the Query
Properties tab.  The parameter names that
you specify must match the names in the query table definition. You
can also provide default values for the parameters, and specify whether
a default value can be overwritten when the query for the view is
run.
4. In the View Properties tab, select
the list columns, list properties, such as ordering properties and
the results threshold, and action bar actions to include in the view.
5. Enter a display name for the view in the View
Name field, and click Check and Save.
The search is run to check for errors. If it runs without
errors, the view is saved. Use the Summary tab
to check the settings that are currently set for the view.

## Results

The new view appears in your navigation pane.
