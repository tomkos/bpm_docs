# SCA bindings

You use IBMÂ® Integration
Designer to
generate and configure SCA bindings on imports and exports in SCA
modules.

If modules are running on the same server or are deployed in the
same cluster, an SCA binding is the easiest and fastest binding to
use.

After the module that contains the SCA binding is deployed to the
server, you can use the administrative console to view information
about the binding or, in the case of an import binding, to change
selected properties of the binding.
