# Configuring Business Automation Workflow and VMM by using a
group membership property that reflects all users in a group

## About this task

Consider using this procedure only if all involved LDAP servers expose an attribute that
reflects direct and indirect users within a group.
For
example, IBM Security Directory
Suite can be configured to
expose for a group entry the ibm-allmembers attribute, which can be queried
directly to retrieve all user members of the group.

To configure Business Automation Workflow and VMM by using a
group membership property that reflects all users in a group, you make all file changes in the
deployment manager profile (DmgrProfile). After you are finished, you stop the JVMs, deployment
manager, and node agents, and then you restart the deployment manager, synchronize the node agents,
and start the servers.

## Procedure

1. Extend the VMM entity type Group to include an extra property with the name
groupusermember.  

The file is called wimxmlextension.xml and is located in the
install\_root/profiles/profile/config/cells/cell/wim/model directory. If this
directory contains no such file, create a file called wimxmlextension.xml. For
example:
IBM/BPM/v8.5/profiles/DmgrProfile/config/cells/PCCell1/wim/model/wimxmlextension.xml

In a cluster, the wimxmlextension.xml file is on the deployment manager for
each server of the cluster.
Add the following configuration to the wimxmlextension.xml
file:<sdo:datagraph xmlns:sdo="commonj.sdo"
        xmlns:wim="http://www.ibm.com/websphere/wim">
      <wim:schema>
    	<wim:propertySchema nsURI="http://www.ibm.com/websphere/wim" dataType="STRING"
            multiValued="true" propertyName="groupusermember">
          <wim:applicableEntityTypeNames>Group</wim:applicableEntityTypeNames>
        </wim:propertySchema>
      </wim:schema>
    </sdo:datagraph>
2. For each LDAP directory configured for VMM, define the mapping between the VMM
					property name groupusermember and the corresponding available
					LDAP attribute; for example, ibm-allMembers.
Include in the
							install\_root/profiles/profile/config/cells/cell/wim/config/wimconfig.xml
					file (in a cluster, on the deployment manager for each server of the cluster)
					the
					entry:<config:repositories xsi:type="config:LdapRepositoryType" ...>
    	...
    	<config:attributeConfiguration>
    	...
    	<config:attributes name="ibm-allMembers" propertyName="groupusermember">
    	  <config:entityTypes>Group</config:entityTypes>
    	</config:attributes>
    	...
      </config:attributeConfiguration>
    </config:repositories>
3. For each LDAP directory configured for VMM, tune your LDAP configuration in
					the wimconfig.xml file to allow for the retrieval of all
					groups in one VMM query.
Refer to the VMM tuning documents. Select an appropriate setting for
						configurationProvider->maxSearchResults and adapt other
					values, such as ldapServers->connectTimeout and
						attributesCache->cacheSize, as necessary.
4. Enable the use of the groupusermember properties by Business Automation Workflow. 
Include in the 100Custom.xml file the
entry:<common merge="mergeChildren">
    		<security>
    			<vmm-options>
    				<group-user-member-prop>groupusermember</group-user-member-prop>
    			</vmm-options>
    		</security>
    	</common>The
100Custom.xml file is in the
install\_root/profiles/profile/config/cells/cell/nodes/node/servers/server/process-center|process-server/config
directory. In a cluster, the 100Custom.xml file is on the deployment manager
for each server of the cluster.
5. After all files are created or updated, stop all Business Automation Workflow JVMs, node agent, and deployment manager.
6 Start the servers in the following order by running the appropriate commands.
    1. Start Deployment Manager.
    2. Run a syncNodes command in the node profile. For more information, see the
WebSphereÂ® Application
Server synchronization
process page.
    3. Start nodeAgent.
    4. Start the messaging servers.
    5. Start AppTarget servers.
    6. Start the Support server.
