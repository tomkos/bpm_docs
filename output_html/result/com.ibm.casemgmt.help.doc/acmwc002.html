<h1>Case Toolbar widget events</h1>

<p>For example, the Case Toolbar widget handles an incoming
event to display the properties for a case type so that the user can
create a case.</p>

<p>The Case Toolbar widget also
publishes events for certain actions that you add to the widget.</p>

<ul>
<li>Case Toolbar widget incoming events</li>
</ul>

<p>The Case Toolbar widget provides incoming events to handle the data that is received from other widgets.</p>
