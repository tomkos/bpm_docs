# Modifying configuration properties

You can modify all the general configuration properties in the
ibmPfs\_federatedSystem element for a federated system, except the
index.number\_of\_shards property. In addition, you can modify the indexer and
retriever implementation properties that are specific to the system type.

See the lists of all the configuration properties of  the
ibmPfs\_federatedSystem element.
