# Organizing projects using integration solutions

An integration solution is a non-deployable project that
is solely used to reference other projects in the workspace, such
as modules, mediation modules, libraries, component test projects,
Java projects, and simple projects. Integration solutions help you
organize groups of related projects and more easily perform common
actions on the projects, such as sharing them in a team environment.
When you create a new integration solution, an integration solution
diagram is automatically generated. You can open the integration solution
diagram in the integration solution editor and view the relationships
between the related projects that are referenced in the integration
solution.

## About this task

- Integration solution editor (deprecated)

When you create a new integration solution, an integration solution diagram is automatically generated. The integration solution editor enables you to open the integration solution diagram and view the relationships between the related projects that are referenced in the integration solution.
- Creating integration solutions

Using the New Integration Solution wizard, you can create a new integration solution to organize your projects.
- Opening integration solution diagrams

When you create an integration solution, an integration solution diagram is automatically added that you can open in the integration solution editor.
- Adding project references to integration solutions

In either the Business Integration view or the integration solution editor, you can add project references to an integration solution, such as module, mediation module, library, or component test project references.
- Removing project references from integration solutions

In either the Business Integration view or the integration solution editor, you can remove project references from an integration solution, such as module, mediation module, library, or component test project references.
- Working with integration solutions in the Business Integration view

In the Business Integration view, there are a number of tools that you can use to more easily manage your integration solutions. For example, if you have a lot of integration solutions, you can choose to focus one and hide the rest.
- Editing integration solutions in the integration solution editor

When you create an integration solution, an integration solution diagram is also automatically created. You can open the integration solution diagram in the integration solution editor and perform numerous tasks, such as displaying transaction paths between components or launching project or resource editors to view or edit projects and resources.
- Testing integration solutions

Using the integration test client, you can test one or more projects that are referenced by your integration solution, such as modules, mediation modules, and component test projects.
