# Case management solution concepts

The
document class maps to a document class in the Content Platform Engine, or to
an item type in IBMÂ® Content
Manager.

You define
roles for the entire solution. You then associate roles with activities.
You assign users and groups to roles in the Case Client to specify
which users can access a particular activity or step. Because you
define roles for the solution, you can reuse those roles across all
case types when you design the solution. When you create activities
or steps, you can assign roles to the activity or step from roles
that are already defined for the solution, or you can create a new
role for the solution.

Case Builder includes
a set of pages that you can use in your solution. You can customize
these pages to meet the requirements of your solution. You can use
these pages as templates to create additional pages to provide customized
views for different roles, case types, and activities.
