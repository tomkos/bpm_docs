## About this task

The following steps describe how to add a decision task
to a service flow and then adding decision tables or action rules

## What to do next

- Using decision tables in the Process Designer

You can author decision tables in a Decision task to implement decision logic in your service flow.
- Using action rules in the Process Designer

You can create action rules in a Decision task to implement decision logic in your service flow.
- Exporting rules and decision tables for use in Rule Designer

You can export a set of action rules and decision rules from the Process Designer to create a project file that you can then import and work on in IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM) Rule Designer.
