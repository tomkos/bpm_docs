# Service Integration Bus Browser

Each deployment environment has its own bus. The single bus is called
BPM.deployment\_environment\_name.Bus. Examples of day-to-day operations
include browsing service integration buses, viewing runtime properties for messaging engines, or
managing messages on message points. The browser is not intended as a bus configuration tool.

Note that not all pages can be edited when accessed from a link in the navigation tree. See the
online help for the browser for more detail, including how to access versions of the page that can
be edited.
