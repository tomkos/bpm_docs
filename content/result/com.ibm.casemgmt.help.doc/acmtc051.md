# Different browsers can display workflow group fields differently in Case Client

Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome have different sorting
algorithms. Different algorithms can cause differences in the order that is used to display fields
that include workflow groups. For example, in one browser, workflow groups might display at the top
of the view while in another browser, workflow groups might display at the bottom of the view.

If you want to avoid this issue, always use the same browser to access Case Client or use a user-created
property view.
