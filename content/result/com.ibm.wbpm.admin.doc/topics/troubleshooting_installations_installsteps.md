# Snapshot installation process

The following steps happen on the target server during
the installation process.

| Action taken on the target workflow server                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1. Install the necessary library items and assets for the process application and referenced toolkits. | The installation process deploys only those referenced toolkits that are not already on the target server. Default values for environment variables and exposed process values (EPVs) are set, and other design-time versioned assets (such as Portal searches) are created.                      |
| 2. Run the deployment service flow for each toolkit.                                                   | The deployment service flow for each referenced toolkit must be started before the deployment service flow for the referring toolkit.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3. Run the deployment service flow for the process application.                                        | The deployment service flow for the process application is the final deployment service flow that is started.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4. Migrate data and process instances if there are running business process definition instances.      | The workflow server migrates data according to the principles outlined in Development strategies for migrating instances. The specific actions of this step depend on the migration option that you choose. The migration options are described in Migrating snapshots by using Workflow Center . |
| 5. Send tracking definitions to the Performance Data Warehouse.                                        | The workflow server updates the Performance Data Warehouse with any new or changed tracking definitions.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6. Activate scheduled undercover agents (UCAs).                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7. Deploy advanced content.                                                                            | If the snapshot has advanced content, then the advanced artifacts, such as SCA modules and libraries, are deployed to the workflow server.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 8. On a connected workflow server, send a message saying the installation is complete.                 | The user who initiated the installation can see the completion message in Workflow Center.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
