# Integration solution editor (deprecated)

When you create a new integration solution, an integration
solution diagram is automatically generated. The integration solution
editor enables you to open the integration solution diagram and view
the relationships between the related projects that are referenced
in the integration solution.

In the Business Integration view, you can open the integration
solution editor by expanding your integration solution and double-clicking
the Solution Diagram.

- 1 Integration solution diagram
- 2 Modules and mediation modules
- 3 Toolbar

These three areas are described in the following sections.

## Integration solution diagram

An integration
solution diagram is consists of one or more projects that are referenced
from the integration solution. By default, only modules and mediation
modules are displayed in an integration solution diagram. However,
you can choose to also display libraries and other projects like Java
projects and component test projects that are referenced by the modules.

You
can also choose to display an integration overview, which is a small
image of the current and entire integration solution. The overview
is displayed in the lower right corner of the integration solution
editor, as shown in the following figure:

## Modules or mediation modules

Although modules
and mediation modules are always displayed in an integration solution
diagram, their components, imports, and exports are not displayed
by default. However, you can choose to expand the modules to display
the components, imports, and exports and also highlight the transaction
path between them.

## Toolbar

The toolbar in the integration solution
editor is consists of several icons that are used to initiate numerous
tasks. The toolbar icons and their associated tasks are described
in the following table:

| Icon   | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|        | Toggles between showing and hiding libraries and other projects that are referenced by modules and mediation modules in the integration solution.                                                                                                                        |
|        | Toggles between showing and hiding the name and type of an import, export, or component when you hover your cursor over it.                                                                                                                                              |
|        | Automatically rearranges the layout of an integration solution to improve its visibility.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|        | Toggles between showing and hiding a small overview image (that represents the entire integration solution) in the lower right corner of the integration solution editor.                                                                                                |

|        | Adds a sticky note to the integration solution. Using the Ctrl key and the arrow keys in combination, you can move sticky notes left, right, up, or down. Using the Ctrl+Shift keys and the arrow keys in combination, you can resize a sticky note in any direction.    |
|        | Connects a sticky note to a selected module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|        | Resizes the integration solution diagram to the show the entire diagram in the current size of the editor. As long as you do not use the zoom icons, the diagram will be automatically resized to fit the size of the window even if the window is maximized or dragged. |
|        | Reduces the size of the integration solution diagram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|        | Reduces the size of the integration solution diagram when slid to the left and increases the size of the diagram when slid to the right.                                                                                                                                 |
