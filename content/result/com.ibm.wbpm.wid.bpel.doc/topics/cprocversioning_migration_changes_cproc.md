# BPEL process model changes and runtime migration

- BPEL process migration: Changes to the descriptive and quality-of-service properties of process instances

If the new version of the BPEL process contains only changes to the descriptive, or quality-of-service properties, or both, you can migrate existing process instances at any time during the process navigation.
- BPEL process migration: Changes to the business logic of a process instance

If a new version of a BPEL process contains business logic changes, a process instance can be migrated if the process navigation has not yet reached any of these changes.
- Additional considerations for BPEL process instance migration

In addition to the changes that are allowed to the properties and the business logic, there are some additional considerations and limitations that apply to the migration of BPEL process instances.
