# Testing and Debugging

- Unit testing

Modules are typically developed independently of other modules. Within a module, a component does not need or have visibility to another component's implementation. In Integration Designer, the integration test client is the designated tool for testing modules and components in isolation. The test client features a sophisticated user interface that enables you to easily manage and precisely control your tests.
- Cross-component trace

SOA applications tend to be large and complex, and are typically composed of other applications. The most time spent in troubleshooting an SOA application is often in narrowing the problem to a particular area. This is where cross-component trace is one of your most useful tools.
- Testing web services

You can use the Web Services Explorer to test web services.
- Debugging mediation flows

The integration debugger allows you to debug your mediation flow component using a graphical user interface. You can control the flow execution by using breakpoints to step over the running of mediation primitives. When the server is running in debug mode, and a breakpoint is encountered, the running stops. When a component thread pauses at a breakpoint, you can control program flow or alter the state of the running component. You can use the variables view to inspect the data or message.
