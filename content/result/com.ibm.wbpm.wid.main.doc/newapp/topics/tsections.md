# Hiding or displaying sections for integration solutions and
projects

By default, the Business Integration view is divided into
two sections - the Integration Solutions section
and the Projects section. These two sections
help keep integration solutions separate from the projects that they
referenced. However, you can choose to either hide or display the
two sections. If you choose to hide the two sections, all of the integration
solutions and referenced projects will be displayed together in the
Business Integration view.
