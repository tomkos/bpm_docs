# Using the visual snippet editor to write Java code

The answer to this is part personal choice, and part skill level.

If you are not familiar with the Java programming
language, then this choice is made for you, and you must use the graphical
editor to visually compose expressions that can then be generated
into valid Java code.

If you are comfortable coding using Java,
then there will be times that you may find it easier to simply type
it yourself, especially for simple code. The biggest advantage of
the visual snippet editor for experienced users, is the fact that
the editor will generate a lot of code very quickly, and ultimately
save the user a lot of typing.
