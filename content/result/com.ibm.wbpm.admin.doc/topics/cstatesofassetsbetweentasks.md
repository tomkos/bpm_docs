| New       | The asset is only in the source snapshot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Updated   | The asset is in both the source snapshot and the tip of the destination branch and is of the same version, but the asset includes at least one updated dependency in the tip of the destination branch. The asset is in both the source snapshot and the tip of the destination branch and is of the same version, but at least one of its dependencies is not in the tip of the destination branch. The asset is in both the source snapshot and the tip of the destination branch but each asset is of a different version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Conflict  | An asset dependency in the source snapshot cannot be resolved because of one of the following situations: An asset in a snapshot (asset A) depends on another asset in that same snapshot (asset B), and asset B gets deleted. An asset in a snapshot (asset A) depends on another asset in a snapshot or a toolkit (asset B), and the project dependency on the toolkit gets removed.   An asset depends on an asset from a toolkit and both of the following conditions occur: Both the source snapshot and the tip of the destination branch include the same toolkit as a dependency. This dependency points to a different snapshot of the toolkit.   If the asset is in both the source snapshot and the tip of destination branch and is of the same version, but the asset includes a dependency that is in the Conflict state, then the asset is marked to be in the No Change state. |
| No Change | The asset is in both the source snapshot and the tip of the destination branch and is of the same version. All the present dependencies are of the same version.  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

When copying an object identified as New from a source branch to a
destination branch, an error might occur with a message stating that an object with that name
already exists in the target. In this case, the objects have the same name, but are in fact
different objects. In order to proceed with the copy operation, one of the objects can be renamed,
or the object in the tip, which is the current working version of the process application, can be
deleted.
