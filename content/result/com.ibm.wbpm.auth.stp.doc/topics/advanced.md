# Advanced development topics

- Adding Java to the application

Although IBM Integration Designer is designed so that you can do most tasks without coding directly in Javaâ„¢, it does provide the capability to do so in many ways.
- Customizing behavior with visual snippets

To graphically define custom behavior, use the visual snippet editor.
- Creating XPath expressions

Some artifacts that you can create in IBM Integration Designer, such as mediation flows and BPEL processes, support the use of the XPath standard. For example, in mediation flows, the message logger's root property takes an XPath expression that specifies which part of the message is available to the primitive for processing. You can use the XPath Expression Builder to specify an XPath 1.0 expression.
- Controlling system retries

A critical aspect of designing your error handling strategy is to have visibility and control of system retries in your application.
- Creating end-to-end security

There are a number of potential end-to-end security scenarios for IBM Business Process Manager Advanced, each involving differing security steps. Several typical scenarios, with the necessary security options, are presented in this topic.
- Assuring Quality of Service

 Qualifiers propagate transactions and control the quality and timing of message delivery.
