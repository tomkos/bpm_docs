# Templates

The template also serves as a way to update multiple views simultaneously. Because the template
is a reference to a view and not a copy, if you change the template, all the views based on that
template are updated as well with those changes. To continue the previous example, you update the
template to change the logo image. All the views that use your template are updated with the new
logo.
