<h1>Removing a reused process from a solution</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To remove a reused process from a solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the solution in IBM
FileNet Process Designer.</li>
<li>Optional: 
If the reused process is the main
workflow, set another workflow definition as the main workflow by
clicking Action &gt; Set
as Main Workflow.</li>
<li>Select the workflow to delete by clicking View &gt; Workflows &gt; workflow
name and then selecting Action &gt; Remove Workflow.</li>
</ol>

<p>Important: Validation errors occur if you remove a global workflow that is
      referenced by any task workflows. To avoid the errors, you must modify the task workflows so
      that they do not reference the removed global workflow.</p>
