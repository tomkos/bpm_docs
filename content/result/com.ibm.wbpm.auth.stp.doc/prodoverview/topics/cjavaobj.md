# Java objects

Implementations usually use a WSDL interface type; some use a Java
interface. If multiple interfaces are specified, then you cannot mix
WSDL interfaces with Java interfaces.
You can, however, join an application created with a set of
WSDL interfaces to an application with a set of Java interfaces. A sample listed in the samples
gallery of the Welcome view shows you how.

When you work with a Java object,
the code remains hidden from you within the context of the editors.
