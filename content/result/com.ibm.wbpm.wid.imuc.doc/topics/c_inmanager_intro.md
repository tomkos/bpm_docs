# Overview

IBM Installation Manager
offers a number of time-saving features. It keeps track of what you
are about to install, software components that you have already installed,
and components that are available for you to install. It searches
for updates so you know that you are installing the latest version
of an IBM Integration
Designer product
package. Installation Manager also provides tools for managing licenses
for the product packages that it installs. It provides tools for updating
and modifying packages. You can also use Installation Manager to uninstall
product packages.

Installation Manager comprises seven wizards that make it easy
to maintain your product packages through their lifecycles:

- The Install Packages wizard walks you through
the installation process. You can install a product package by simply
accepting the defaults, or you can modify the default settings to
create a custom installation. Before you install a product package,
you are provided with a complete summary of the selections that you
have made throughout the wizard. With the wizard you can install one
or more product packages at the same time.
- The Update Packages wizard searches for
available updates to product packages that you have installed. An
update might be a released fix, a new feature, or a new version of
the product. Details of the contents of the update are provided in
the wizard. You can choose whether to apply an update.
- With the Modify Packages wizard, you can
modify specific elements of a package that you have already installed.
During your initial installation of the product package, you select
the features you want to install. If you find later that you require
other features, you can use the Modify Packages wizard to add them
to your product package installation. You can also remove features,
and add or remove languages.
- The Manage Licenses wizard helps you to
set up the licenses for your packages. Use this wizard to change your
trial license to a full license, to set up your servers for floating
licenses, and to select which type of license to use for each package.
This wizard is not used for the IBM Integration
Designer packages.
- The Import  wizard helps you to add existing
packages that were installed using installation tools other than Installation
Manager so that they can be managed by Installation Manager.
- With the Roll Back Packages wizard you
can revert to a previously installed version of an eligible package.
- The Uninstall Packages wizard helps you
to remove a product package from your computer. You can uninstall
more than one package at a time.
