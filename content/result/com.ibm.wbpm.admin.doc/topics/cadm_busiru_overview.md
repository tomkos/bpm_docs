# Overview of business rules

## What is a business rule?

A business rule
is anything that imposes structure upon or controls the behavior of
a business practice. A rule can enforce business policy, establish
common guidelines within an organization, or control access in a business
environment.

## When to use a business rule

- Determining current interest rates
- Calculating discounts for products
- Calculating sales tax
- Determining special groups such as senior citizens or preferred
customers

## How to use business rules

Develop and deploy
business rules using the Eclipse-based business rules editors in IBMÂ® Integration
Designer.
Manage and modify business rule values using the web-based business
rules manager, which is an option of IBM Workflow
Server.
For more information about these tools, see the appropriate topics
in the IBM Integration
Designer Information
Center and the IBM Workflow
Server Information
Center.

- Displaying business rule components

Displaying business rule components is the first step in administering a business rule group. From the display you can export or import any or all of the business rule groups or display the tables that make up the business rule groups.
