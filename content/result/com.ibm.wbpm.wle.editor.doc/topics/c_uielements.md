# User interface concepts

<!-- image -->

When you develop process applications, you use the designer to create coaches and views for client-side human services
or heritage human services(deprecated). When the human service is
running, users see and interact with the coaches and views that you built in a web browser.

- Themes

A theme consists of a set of theme definitions, dynamic stylesheets, and generated CSS that you can apply to a process application or toolkit.
- Human services

You can use human services to provide interfaces that users can use to manage their process and case work in web-based applications.
- Dashboards

A dashboard is a user interface that displays business process information. Authorized users use the dashboard to interact with that information.
- Coaches

Coaches are the user interfaces for human services.
- Views

Views are reusable sets of user interface widgets, such as text fields, date time pickers, and buttons, that users can use to interact with a business object or service. Views can comprise one or more sets of other views, data bindings, layout instructions, and behaviors.
- Advanced items for views

Add advanced items to a view to enhance its content. Unlike most palette items, advanced items are not views or variables.
- Heritage artifacts

IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow contains a number of artifacts that are labeled heritage.
