# Data Section

## Restrictions and limitations

- This view supports only the Required, Hidden,
and None visibility properties.
- If you use this view in a custom dashboard, you
also need to add the Refresh Controller view to the custom dashboard
to enable the contents of the view to be refreshed. To enable users
to also manually refresh the contents of the view, add Refresh Button
to the dashboard, too. For more information, see Refresh Controller control and Refresh Button control.

## Customizing the Data Section coach view

For
this implementation, ensure that the value of the Edit
mode configuration property is set to false (the
default setting).

The Save button is enabled when
a change is detected to data that is bound to a coach view in the
content box. When the button is clicked, a boundary event is triggered,
which can trigger a service call to save the data. For example, in
a custom instance UI, you can wire the event to a General System service
that is configured to send the variable updates to the parent instance.
The Instance Details UI Service Template in the Dashboards toolkit
contains an example implementation.

The edit mode
also supports data synchronization if the Boundary event
type, Incoming changes, and Local
changes configuration properties are bound to variables.
When updates to instance data are detected on the server, information
in these variables is used to display merge options to the user in
the coach view.

- Change the name of the section by updating the Section
title configuration property
- Change the expand and collapse behavior of the view by updating
the Collapsible and Collapsed configuration
properties
