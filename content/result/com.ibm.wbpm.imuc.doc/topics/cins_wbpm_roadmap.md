- Roadmap: Installing and configuring IBM Business Automation Workflow

The IBM Business Automation Workflow installation and configuration programs accommodate various scenarios. This roadmap guides you through the most common paths for installing and configuring IBM Business Automation Workflow.
- Planning for IBM Business Automation Workflow

To ensure that the system that you implement meets your needs, plan your IBM Business Automation Workflow before you introduce its software into your enterprise information system.
- Swinging profiles between product installations

You can configure your environment to use a common set of profiles that you associate with multiple installations. Customers who provision many servers might use this method to keep their environments at equivalent service levels, especially for the underlying WebSphere environment and Java security patches. The service level is the release version of the software.
- Preparing to install and configure the software

Before preparing to install and configure the software, create a plan for the deployment environment that you want to create.
- Installing and configuring IBM Business Automation Workflow

You can install IBM Business Automation Workflow using typical, custom, or silent installation. Typical installation creates a single-cluster environment and does not need any more configuration. For IBM Business Automation Workflow Enterprise, you can configure a single-cluster or a three-cluster deployment environment. IBM Business Automation Workflow Express is always a single-cluster environment.
- Starting your environment by using Quick Start

After you install IBM Business Automation Workflow and configure a deployment environment, you can use the Quick Start console to start and stop the deployment environment, access the product documentation, or access the administrative consoles related to the deployment environment.
- Backing up databases

After you have installed IBM Business Automation Workflow, create backup copies of the databases.
