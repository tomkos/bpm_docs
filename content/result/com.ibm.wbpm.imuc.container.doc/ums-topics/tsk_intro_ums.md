# Installing and configuring User Management Services on Containers

- Preparing to install User Management Services

 Containers: 
UMS includes two options: UMS SSO and UMS Teams. If you want your app users to benefit from single sign-on and shared teams, you must install UMS before you install any apps that rely on it. Before you deploy User Management Service, you must prepare your environment. These procedures include setting up the database and creating secrets.
- Configuring User Management Services

 Containers: 
User Management Services configuration settings are stored in the shared custom resource (CR) file for operator deployment.
- Completing post-deployment tasks for User Management Service

 Containers: 
 You can perform optional configuration tasks for User Management Service (UMS) to configure Business Automation Workflow or IBM Process Federation Server to use UMS, or delegating authentication to an OIDC or SAML identity provider.
- Using the User Management Services

 Containers: 
 User Management Services (UMS) provide single sign-on (SSO) and Teams options, which provide users of multiple applications with a single sign-on experience and centrally administered teams.
