# Content event types

The following table lists the types of content events
that you can select when you configure an event subscription in Process Designer. On IBM®
FileNet® Content Manager,
all of these event types are supported and an event handler is provided.

However, on other ECM systems, some of the event types
are not supported and you need to develop your own event handler.
Information about how to develop an event handler for the supported
event types is found in the topic Creating an event handler for an Enterprise Content Management system.
