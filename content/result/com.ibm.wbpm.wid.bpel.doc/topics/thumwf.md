# Modeling human workflows

## About this task

## Procedure

- Human task activity. Use the human task activity
to send a process-related task out to a human for completion. This
activity is used in conjunction with the human task editor.
- Collaboration scope. A collaboration scope is
a flexible workflow for human activities, where a greater emphasis
is placed on the expertise of the user to adapt the business flow
to the requirements on a particular case.

- Adding a human task

A human task is, quite simply, a unit of work done by a person. When used from the BPEL process editor, it can either send a process-related task out to a person for completion, or receive a message from a person into the process.
- Adding a collaboration scope

Collaboration scopes allow you to create enhanced dynamic workflows.
