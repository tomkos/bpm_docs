| Details        | Information about the instance such as the process name, process application name, its status, and when the process instance started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Activities     | The ad hoc activities in the process, and the actions that you can take for each activity. You can filter the activities by state. Ready shows manual activities that are in READY or WAITING state. In progress shows all activities that are in WORKING state or automatic activities that are in WAITING state.  Complete shows activities that are in COMPLETED, FAILED, and DISABLED states.  All shows all activities regardless of their state.  You can click an activity to view information about it.                                                                                                                                   |

You can click a task to view information about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Location       | For tasks, the step that currently has a token and all of its parent processes that are waiting on that token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Data           | The data associated with the selected process instance, activity, or task. The data is editable so that you can change its values unless the process instance is completed or terminated or the task is closed. Data for instances or tasks in these states is not editable. For example, if you have an activity that has a problem and is not updating certain variables, you can edit those variables so that they have the appropriate values when the flow leaves that activity.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Timers         | The timers that are currently active. You can trigger a timer to immediately send the flow along the path that exits from the timer. For example, a review activity has an attached timer (a boundary event) that leads to an escalation path. If you override the timer, the flow immediately takes the escalation path. Overriding a timer that creates a delay cancels the delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Message events | The message events that are currently waiting to receive a message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Relationships  | The relationships that the selected instance has with other instances. Each relationship is of one of the following types: Related, which means that the selected instance has an independent association with the other instance. Dependent, which means that the selected instance is a dependent of the other instance such as a child in a parent-child relationship. Dependency, which means that the selected instance depends on the other instance such as the parent in a parent-child relationship. With this type of relationship, certain actions that you perform on the selected instance are also performed on the other instance. |
