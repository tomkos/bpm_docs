# Working with modules in the administration widgets

A graphical view visually represents the services exposed and invoked by a module with
appropriate contextual information about each. Detailed information about the module is also
available and includes the module version, cell identifier (used to uniquely identify a versioned
module in a cell), and endpoints. The graphical view provides overall module status and highlights
any existing configuration problems.

The Module Browser widget is used with other administration widgets. It enables you to list the
names of any properties and policies defined for the module. In addition, if you are using IBMÂ® Workflow
Server, it lists the business rules, BPEL
processes, business state machines, human tasks, business calendars, and security roles defined for
the module. Select an artifact from the list in this widget to perform any necessary administration
tasks in related widgets.

- What services are consumed in or exposed by a module?
