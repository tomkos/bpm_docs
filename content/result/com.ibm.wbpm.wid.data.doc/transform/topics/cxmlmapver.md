# Setting the map generation type

Maps transform XML documents to other document formats. You can
use the Generation page of the map editor Properties view to specify
the type of map you want to generate.

The type that you generate from an XML map must match the version
of the Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) and XPath
functions used by the transformations contained in the XML map. By
default, XML maps generate XSLT 1.0; however, you can set the map
to generate either XSLT 2.0 or a business object map.

An XML map can be set to generate either an XSLT or a business
object map. With either an XSLT or business object map generation,
when you generate a target map from the source, the attributes of
the source are mapped to the target map.

## Generating a map

To specify the type of
map you want to generate, open a map in the XML map editor Properties > Generation view.
