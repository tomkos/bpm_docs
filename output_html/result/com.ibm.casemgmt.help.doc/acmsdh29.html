<h1>Sample routes for a workflow</h1>

<p>Most
workflows require branching at various points as the result of a response
made by a participant. In the illustration about the route condition,
the route from the launch step is always true. The route from the
Eval step depends on the value of a response by the participant at
the Eval step. Only one of the routes is taken.</p>

<p>For example,
if the Eval step requires the participant to respond by choosing either
"OK" or "No," you can define two routes from the step: one route for
the OK response and one for the No response. This type of step is
called an OR-split.</p>

<p>When
there are multiple routes from a step and more than one of those routes
can evaluate to true, then work can continue down multiple paths simultaneously.
The work proceeds along all true routes.</p>

<p>In the illustration
about AND conditions, the Write step uses an AND-split. The route
to Graphics is always true, and the Start review path and the Request
graphics path are both processed. The Start review step is an OR-split
that processes either Review A or Review B. The case worker sees that
there are two separate work items: one for Graphics and one for either
A or B.</p>

<p>To create a valid map, you must define a collector
step that brings the work back into a single path at the end of all
the true routes. In this illustration, the Edit step is the collector
step and is an AND-join.</p>

<p>The processing waits just before the
collector step (Edit) until all of the child processes reach this
stage.</p>
