# Basic searches in Workplace

Basic searches enable you to build simple field
operator
value filters and combine them by using the AND keyword.
Additional keywords such as OR and NOT are not available in basic
searches. To refine the results of your search, you might need to define and maintain multiple basic
queries. You can also name and save your customized views for reuse or share them with other people
or your teams.

## Full-text search

- In Process Portal, the
full-text search uses the Lucene search index, which does not depend on the Process Federation Server or any external
features.
- For Workplace in
Business Automation Workflow releases earlier
than 24.0.0.0, the full-text search is enabled only when the Process Federation Server (either
external or embedded) is configured.
- For Workplace in
Business Automation Workflow 24.0.0.0, which
has the federated data repository enabled, the full-text search is also available.

## Customize your views

The highly customizable Workplace enables you to tailor
your own custom views that display the most relevant information, search for specific items in
larger sets, and can be reused for frequently used queries.
