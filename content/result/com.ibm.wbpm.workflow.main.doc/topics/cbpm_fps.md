# Getting started with Process Federation Server

- Your process applications are deployed on different Business Automation Workflow deployment
environments. Your users must log on to several different instances
of Process Portal to
get their work done.
- Your users work with both BPD-related and BPEL-related processes
and tasks.
- Your Business Automation Workflow environment
contains multiple versions of Business Automation Workflow that
each runs a different version of the same process application. Your
users need to work with the older versions of the process applications
while process instances are still running, which means that they need
to log on to the Process Portal or Heritage Process Portal application
that runs on the associated version of Business Automation Workflow.

Process Federation Server aggregates
both BPD and BPEL-related tasks from all the Business Automation Workflow back-end
systems, including systems that run previous versions of Business Automation Workflow that
are supported by Process Federation Server.
You can take advantage of this support to gradually phase out process
applications that are still running on previous versions, while new
versions of the process applications run on the latest release of Business Automation Workflow. For
more information about the Business Automation Workflow versions
that are supported by Process Federation Server,
