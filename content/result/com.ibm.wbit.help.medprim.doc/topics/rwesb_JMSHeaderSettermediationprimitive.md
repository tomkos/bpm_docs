# JMS Header Setter mediation primitive

## Introduction

You can use the JMS Header
Setter mediation primitive to provide a mechanism for managing JMS
headers in the message. You can change, copy, add, or delete JMS headers
by setting the mediation primitive properties.

If you want multiple
header changes you can set multiple actions. Multiple actions are
acted on sequentially, in the order in which they are specified; this
means that header changes can build on each other.

You can create
new JMS headers by specifying header field values. You can search
for JMS headers that already exist in the Service Message Object by
specifying the header name to match on. If a matching header is found,
it can then be deleted from the message, copied to another location
in the SMO, or have the value set. If a matching header is not found,
a new header can be created using a specified header field value.

The
JMS Header Setter mediation primitive has one input terminal (in),
one output terminal (out) and a fail terminal (fail). The in terminal
is wired to accept a message and the other terminals are wired to
propagate a message. If the mediation is successful, the out terminal
propagates the modified message. If an exception occurs during the
transformation, the fail terminal propagates the original message,
together with any exception information contained in the failInfo
element.

- Standard JMS Headers, which have their own schema in the SMO,
located at /headers/JMSHeader.
- Any other headers are User Headers and are listed at /headers/properties.

## Usage

You can use the JMS Header Setter
mediation primitive to ensure that when a JMS message is sent to another
system, via the JMS binding, the headers that are sent with the message
are correctly set.

Because the operations you define occur sequentially,
a later operation can depend on an earlier operation. For example,
you could create a new header, copy it to elsewhere in the SMO and
then delete it from the list of headers it was initially appended
to.

You can also use the JMS Header Setter mediation primitive
to help to filter messages, using the Message Filter mediation primitive.
You might want to find a particular header and make it available to
be used in the filtering.

- JMS Header Setter mediation primitive properties

You can specify values for mediation primitive properties either by using the property fields in the IBMÂ® Integration Designer user interface or by using an XML format. The property field names displayed in IBM Integration Designer are generally different from the property names used when building a mediation flow using XML code. In the following information, icons are used to identify each property name used in IBM Integration Designer and the corresponding XML name. (Where applicable, XML names that are required, but not shown in IBM Integration Designer, are also described.)
