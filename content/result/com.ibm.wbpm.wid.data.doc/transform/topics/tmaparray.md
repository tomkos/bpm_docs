# Mapping array elements using an XML map

## About this task

## Procedure

1 Drag your mouse between the input and output elements tocreate a mapping. A default transform is assigned. If you have morethan one input element:
    1. Drag your mouse between the first input element and
the output element to create a mapping. A default transform is assigned.
    2. Drag your mouse from the second input element to the
transform.
    3. Repeat for each input element.  The
transform type will change to the default type for multiple input
elements.
2. If you want to change the transform type, select the transform,
right click, and Change transform type.
3. Click the transform, and click the Properties view.
4. Select the indexes of the elements that you want the transform
to operate on by setting the input and output array indexes on the
Cardinality page. See Selecting the indexes of input and output array elements from the cardinality properties page. for examples.
For the Merge transform, indicate which input
array to iterate over.
5. On the Conditions page, set a processing condition, if
required. The transform will run only if the condition is fulfilled.
6. If you have multiple input elements, click Order to
specify the order in which the input elements will be processed.
