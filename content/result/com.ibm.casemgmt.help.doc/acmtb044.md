# Case and attachment documents with non-English-language titles are added to email with
incorrect titles

Titles for English documents are correct in the email. For example, a graphic that has an English
title is correctly labeled MyGraphic.jpg when it is added to email. A graphic
with a non-English-language title is incorrectly labeled wcEmail.jpg when it is
added to email.
