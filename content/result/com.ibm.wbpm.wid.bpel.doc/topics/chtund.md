# Human Task editor

The Human Task editor is divided into several areas, each with
its own purpose.

<!-- image -->

1 The Service Interface area
    - This area shows the interface that is associated with this human
task.
    - You cannot modify the fields in this area, but you can launch
the interface editor and make the necessary changes if you click the
name of the interface.
2 The People Assignment area

- This area shows details about the assignments of people who initiate
or receive tasks. The display that you see depends on what type of
human task you are working with.
- The table shows a list of roles that users can assume when working
with the task. When you click the  icon,
you see the people assignments that you can add to this task. To remove
the authorization role that is currently selected, click the  icon.
- Potential Owners > Ownership. To modify the ownership pattern of this human task,
click Single or Parallel.
3 The User Interface area

- In this area, you add additional client-type specific information to a human task that a client
can use in the runtime environment. The information can include an external implementation that is
called when a task is opened in Process Portal. To
add an interface to the palette, click . Then, you configure it in the Details area.
4 The Escalations area

- The escalation settings define how a task should be handled when
an expected result has not been achieved within a set period of time.
5 The Properties view

- This view displays properties that are relevant to the object
that is currently selected in the editor. To move through the pages,
click the tabs to the left of this view. Some pages display properties
in tabular format. You can add or modify these properties by clicking
the appropriate cell and making additions or changes in the graphical
interface that opens. Properties that are marked with an asterisk
(*) are mandatory.
- The contents of the page differ depending on the object chosen.
- To launch a help window, press F1 (or Ctrl+F1 on
a LinuxÂ® system) and click
the link to be taken to the product documentation for more details.

- Replacement variables and context variables

While working with templates, you might want to refer to a variable that will not be resolved until the instance has been started in the runtime environment. This variable is known as a context variable, because its value is dependent upon the task context in which it is exists (or the process context for inline tasks). If you want to refer to such a context variable in a template, you must use a replacement variable.
- Refactoring and business state machines

When you refactor parts of your business state machine, dependencies on those parts are automatically and universally updated throughout the product as a whole.
