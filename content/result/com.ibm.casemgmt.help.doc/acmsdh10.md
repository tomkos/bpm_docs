# Activities in solutions

- Activities that start processes

An activity can represent a process that is performed regularly for a case. As part of the case type, you define the workflow for the activity. This workflow defines the sequence of steps or work items that must be completed for the activity along with the role or user that must complete each step. You can define the process that is associated with the activity in the designer.
- Custom workflow activities

You can enable case workers to create custom activities for a case type. Case workers can create custom workflow activities to address unexpected or one-time activities that are related to a case, but which are not formally defined as part of the solution. For example, a case worker determines that a document needs to be reviewed by a person who is not typically part of the review team for a case.
- To-do tasks

A to-do task represents a simple activity that does not have workflow steps. To-do tasks provide a checklist of tasks that must be done or information that must be collected for a case type. For example, if the solution that you are designing is for automobile claims and one of the case types is for automobile accidents, you can create a to-do task to enter the completion of making contact by telephone with a claimant.
- Quick tasks

A quick task represents a one-time activity that is related to a case but not associated with a workflow. You can enable case workers to create quick tasks for a case type to help them organize their work or address unexpected or one-time tasks. For example, a case worker determines that a follow-up call to a customer is required and adds a quick task to track this requirement. The case worker can assign the quick tasks to another case worker and set a due date.
