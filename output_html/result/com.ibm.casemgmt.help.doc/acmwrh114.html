<li>Case ToolbarNote: Case Toolbar is a required widget that acts as a controller on the page,
passing the correct client-side human service URL to the Client-Side Human Service Viewer when the
page is opened. It is also used to display any case level actions that are not yet available
directly as client-side human service views.</li>
