## Task files

The task files are generated when you create the profile. For command usage, the argument value
for each task is the name of the XML file without the file extension, for example,
configbox.

| Configure Business Rules                                                         | configrules.xml              | This task configures the environment to be able to use rules in solutions. Tips:  You can select only one locale in which to write the business rules for your solutions. If you need to create solutions with business rules in other locales, rerun this task to change the rule persistence locale before you create the solution. After the first rule for a solution is saved, the rule persistence locale cannot be changed. If you rerun this task to change the location of the rules repository directory after you deploy any solutions, complete the following steps after you run the task: Stop Content Platform Engine. From the previous rules repository directory, move the res\_data directory to the new location of the rules repository directory. In a cluster environment, the rules directory must be a shared directory that all Content Platform Engine cluster servers can access. Restart Content Platform Engine. |
