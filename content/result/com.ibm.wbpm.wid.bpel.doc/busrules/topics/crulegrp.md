# Rule group editor

The rule group editor is divided into several distinct areas, each
with its own function.

1 The interface area
    - This area displays the operations interfaces and references that
you can choose from.
    - To create a new interface or reference, click the  icon,
or to remove one, highlight it and click the  icon.
2 The rule logic area

- This area displays the possible rule logic that the operation
can be routed to. You can visually select your date and times using
the interactive calendar, or create your own customized date-based
selection algorithm in the Selection criteria field.
Use the date and time field when you want distinct rule logics to
apply during different periods. For example you may want to offer
a discount on weekends, or you may have a sale which runs until noon.
- To add new rule logic, click the  icon, or to remove one, highlight
it and click the  icon.
3 The properties area

- This area displays properties that are relevant to the object
that is currently selected in the editor. Click the tabs to the left
of this view to toggle through the pages. Some pages display properties
in tabular format, and you can add or modify these properties by clicking
the appropriate cell and then interacting with the graphical interface
that appears.
- The contents of the page will differ on the activity or object
chosen. In all cases, you can click F1 to launch a dedicated help
window.
