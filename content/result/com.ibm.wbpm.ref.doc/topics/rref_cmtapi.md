BPM
Document List

The BPM Document List view displays (in
tabular form) files in the BPM content store.
It provides under one view the ability to upload, delete, and change
the properties of documents. It also allows users to view revisions
associated with a file. This view aggregates the BPM File List, BPM
File Properties, BPM File Revisions, and BPM File Uploader views as
a simpler-to-use but less customizable alternative to the modular
views it contains.
