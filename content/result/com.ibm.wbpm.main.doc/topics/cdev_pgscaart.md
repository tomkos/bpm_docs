# Service Component Architecture programming

- Service Component Definition Language

Service Component Definition Language (SCDL) is an XML-based language used to describe Service Component Architecture (SCA) elements such as modules, components, references, imports, and exports.
- SCA programming model fundamentals

The concept of a software component forms the basis of the Service Component Architecture (SCA) programming model. A component is a unit that implements some logic and makes it available to other components through an interface. A component may also require the services made available by other components. In that case, the component exposes a reference to these services.
- SCA programming techniques

This section provides examples of Service Component Architecture programming techniques.
