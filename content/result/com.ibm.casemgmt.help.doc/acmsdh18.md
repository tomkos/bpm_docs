# Defining case type views

## Before you begin

On the Properties page for the case type, add the properties that are used
for the case type so that you can add them to the views that you define.

## About this task

- The case page layouts that you define here are used to replace the default widget pages that are
provided by the system and created by using customized client-side human services.Tip: The case page layouts that you build using client-side human services offer a new, more flexible
way to build your case interface pages and leverage the same design tools and techniques that you
used to build user interfaces for process user task steps.
- The property views enable you to customize the layout of case properties that you want displayed
when you use the classic case pages that include the Case Properties widget. By
default, the Case Properties widget displays an ordered list of all properties
that are defined for the case type.Note: You do not use property views with case page layouts that
you defined using client-side human services because you can add individual case properties anywhere
you like on those pages.

- The summary properties are displayed in both the Case Summary page widget
and as columns in the Case List page widget.
- If you do not customize the summary, a default set of system properties is used.

- Defining case page layouts

When you design views, you can define case page layouts that associate classic case views with modern Adapter pages that incorporate custom client-side human services.
- Defining properties views

You can define views that provide different layouts for the Properties widget in a case     type.  For example, you can define different layouts to meet the requirements of different roles     or tasks. You can then specify which view of the Properties widget is to be used on a specific     page.
