# Configuring single sign-on for federated environments by using third-party authentication
products

- Third-party authentication in federated process environments

When you are planning a development, test, or production topology for your federated process environment, the default topology will generally consist of two business process management systems, Process Federation Server and a dedicated server that hosts Workplace and Process Portal. However, you can augment the topology with third-party authentication.
- Configuring single sign-on for federated environments by using IBM Security Access Manager WebSEAL

WebSEAL is a high-performance, multi-threaded web server that applies fine-grained security policies to an IBMÂ® Security Access Manager protected web-object space. If your Process Federation Server environment includes WebSEAL, you can configure WebSEAL junctions to support Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) and provide single sign-on (SSO) for users.
- Configuring single sign-on for federated environments by using a custom trust association interceptor (TAI)

You can use third-party authentication solutions to enable single sign-on (SSO). However, you must either develop or purchase a trust association interceptor (TAI) to extend the security infrastructure.
