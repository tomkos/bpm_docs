<h1>Cannot edit locked solution assets</h1>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Another user opens the solution asset in Case Builder and closes the browser
without committing the solution.</li>
<li>Another user opens the solution asset in Case Builder and the session times
out.</li>
<li>Another user opens the solution asset in IBM®
FileNet® Process Designer and closes IBM
FileNet Process Designer without committing the
solution in Case Builder.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diagnosing the problem</h2>

<h2>Resolving the problem</h2>

<p>Determine who is editing the asset by clicking Show Locked Items, and then
ask the user to commit the solution to unlock the asset. If the user cannot commit the solution, for
example the user is on vacation or left the company, ask your system administrator to unlock the
asset by using the Case administration client.</p>
