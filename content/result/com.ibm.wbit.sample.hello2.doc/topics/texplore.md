# Explore the solution

## About this task

To explore the solution:

## Procedure

1. In the Business Integration view, expand the integration
solution HelloWorldPart2, as shown here:
2. Double-click Solution Diagram. The
integration solution diagram opens in the integration solution editor,
as shown in the following figure:   In
the solution editor, you see all three modules inside the integration
solution. The left edge of each module displays an export and the
right edge of each module displays an import (except for the HelloService
module). Any non-SCA imports and exports are connected to the edge
of the integration solution. SCA imports and exports are not connected
to the edge of the integration solution because they are only designed
for direct communication between modules. If a module invokes another
module through an SCA binding, a connection is displayed between the
two modules.
3. In the solution editor, display the library HelloWorldLibrary by
clicking the Show All Projects icon, as shown
in the following figure: The
integration solution diagram now displays the HelloWorldLibrary library
with connections to the modules that reference it, as shown in the
following figure:   If
you want to see the contents in a module, click the Expand
module icon in the upper right corner of the module. For
example, if you click the Expand module icon
on the HelloWorldMediation module, you should see the contents shown
in the following figure:   If you want, you can explore the other icons on
the toolbar as well as the pop-up menu items. For example, the icons
and menu items enable you to open the assembly editor, add sticky
notes for comments, set the background color of a module, and perform
numerous other tasks.
4. Close the solution diagram. If you are prompted to save
your settings, click No.
