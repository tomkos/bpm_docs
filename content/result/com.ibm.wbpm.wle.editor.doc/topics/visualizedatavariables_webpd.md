# Visualize process data variables

## Procedure

1. Open a process.
2. Click the Overview tab.
3. In the Visualization section, click the Launch visualization
button.

The data visualization diagram opens in a new web browser window.
4. Select Data from the drop-down list in the selection area on the left
side in the browser window. Under Variable, click
Inputs, Outputs, or Private and
select the input, output, or private variables that you want to visualize on the activities in the
diagram on the right side.

Variables are displayed as colored icons in the diagram. The activities in the selected process
that have the same variables are represented by icons of the same color. Up to three icons are
displayed on either side of each activity.
5. Click the down arrow spinners below the third icon on either side to display the next three
icons. Click the up arrow spinners on either side to view the earlier icons.
6. Click any colored icon to slide and display the labels that contain the actual variable names
for all same-color icons.
7. Click a subprocess within a process in the diagram to visualize that subprocess.
The input and output variables are global to the process; if you browse into a
subprocess the same variables are displayed. Private variables can be defined on the main process
and the subprocesses inherit them. However, private variables defined on a subprocess are visible
only to that particular subprocess.
8. Click the Minimize button on the left side to hide the variables list and view only the data
visualization diagram. Use the zoom in or zoom out bar in the upper right corner to enlarge or
reduce the diagram view in the browser window.
