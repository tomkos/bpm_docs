<h1>Box actions are not displayed in the Documents view for</h1>

<p>existing solutions</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

action is not displayed in the menu of the Documents view.</li>
<li>The Manage Collaborators and Assign Box Task
actions are not displayed for the Box collaboration
folder.</li>

<p>The Box collaboration actions are
