# installBusinessSpaceWidgets command

The installBusinessSpaceWidgets command
installs, deploys, and registers designated widgets contained in a
compressed file or an enterprise archive (EAR) file. If widgets are
already deployed, the installBusinessSpaceWidgets command
refreshes the binary and registration information.

- [ear\widgets\_name.ear] one or more EAR files.
- [catalog\catalog\_name.xml]
- [endpoints\*.xml] widget endpoints
- [templates\*.zip] Templates must be in a compressed file and follow
IBM Lotus Mashups template format.

The installBusinessSpaceWidgets command

 -widgets widget\_path
 [-save true|false]

## Parameters
