# Run the sample

- Explore the solution

Sometimes you need to obtain a high-level view of your application to see all of the various elements and how they fit together. The integration solution editor can help with this task.
- Deploy and test the modules

You must deploy (publish) your module to your test environment server before you can run and test your mediation.
- Remove the modules from the server

Generally, when you have finished testing a module, you should remove it from the server. This will ensure that the only modules that are deployed to the server are those that you are preparing to test, which will reduce the load on the server and enhance its performance.
