<h1>Widgets</h1>

<p>The default pages in Case Client include
widgets that are already wired together. You can wire other widgets
together, including widgets from other vendors, to create a customized
application.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to create an application for a bank loan
department, you can configure the application so that bank clerks
can initiate loan applications, and managers can approve or deny those
applications. To create this application, you create a Solution space
for the bank by copying the default Solution space. The default Solution
space contains both Work page and Cases page.
The Work page includes the Toolbar and In-baskets
widgets. The Cases page includes the Toolbar,
Search, Case List, and Case Information widgets.</p>

<p>There are two additional spaces, Case Pages space and Step Pages
space, that also include various pre-wired widgets.</p>

<p>After creating space and pages, you can modify the location of
widgets on the pages, add widgets onto pages, and configure the widgets.</p>

<ul>
<li>Attachments widget</li>
</ul>

You can also use the Script Adapter widget to insert logic between widget event communication.
