# Stack

The Stack view is designed to accommodate nested views. As a developer, you create a Stack view
with multiple panes. You then set conditions to select which pane is shown for users to interact
with. At run time, users do not select the pane directly by clicking on it. Typically, the user
makes a choice, and based on that choice, a pane is displayed. The height of the Stack container is
typically the height of the currently displayed content.

Use the Default Pane Index to indicate where the pane must show. This
index starts at 0. If you do not specify this value and data binding is not
specified either, the default index is 0. Specify -1 to show
no pane at all.
