# Exporting configuration properties for comparison

## About this task

You might perform this task to make sure that your Business Automation Workflow configurations
are consistently configured between systems, or to find the differences.
Export a representation of Workflow Server configuration data and use
your own tools to compare the exported files.

- Cell and deployment environment
- Deployment manager and managed node
- Cluster and cluster member
- Data source and JDBC provider information
- Authentication alias and role mapping
- LDAP
- Deployment environment and Process Portal context root prefix (if set in the current deployment
environment)
- Business Process Choreographer customization
- Additional performance tuning configuration properties

## Procedure

To compare configuration properties between two deployment
environments, complete the following steps:

1 Run the BPMConfig â€“export commandto extract the configuration data from each Business Automation Workflow deploymentenvironment. For example: If there is only one deployment environment in the WebSpherecell, you can omit the -de option.Important: Specifya different output directory for each deployment environment. In thecase where a cell has multiple deployment environments, a unique outputdirectory is required for each deployment environment. Table 1. Configuration files for each deploymentenvironment Sample name Description DE\_name .properties This properties file contains the configuration properties from your sourceenvironment. You use this file when you configure the target environment. For more information aboutthe configuration properties, see the topic Configuration properties for the BPMConfig command . fileRegistry.xml If you use a file-based user registry, the user registry file is copied fromthe source environment to be added to the target environment. ltpa.jceks If you use LTPA, the LTPA key file is copied from the source environment to beadded to the target environment. ldap\_additional\_properties.xml If you use a federated repository and an unencrypted LDAP connection in thesource environment, user-defined additional properties of the LDAP server are copied from the sourceenvironment to the output directory, where they are later used automatically to create the targetenvironment.Restriction: If you extend the federated repository to use a custom loginproperty (such as userPrincipalName ) in addition to the defaultuid property in the source environment, LDAP is not configured for the targetenvironment, with the following warning: CWMCB0600W: LDAP could not be configured! You mayconfigure LDAP separately after BPMConfig has terminated successfully. If you see thiswarning, manually configure LDAP with the login properties you want to use after the migration iscomplete. ProcessServer\_100SourceCustomMerged.xml andPDW\_100SourceCustomMerged.xml If you have XML configuration properties files, they are copied from thesource environment. The exported configuration files are merged and renamed to101CustomMigrated.xml in the target environment. Application-config-bpc.xml andresources-bpc.xml If you have Business Process Choreographer that are configured in the sourceenvironment, the configuration files are copied from the source environment to the output directory,where they are later used automatically to create the target environment. Support-config-bpc.xml If you have Business Process Choreographer Archive Manager configured on thesupport cluster in the source environment, the configuration is copied from the source environmentto the output directory, where it is later used automatically to create the targetenvironment.

2 Use your comparison tools to compare the differences betweenthe extracted configuration files for each deployment environment. Tip: Use comparison tools for comparing these files,because most of them are not intended to be human-readable. .

- To compare XML files: If the XML files are very different, you
might first want to sort all XML elements and attributes based on
your needs using a tool, for example, XML Sorter. Then, using a comparison
tool, for example, Pretty Diff, Altova DiffDog, or Stylus Studio XML
Editor, compare the extracted XML files for each deployment environment.
- To compare properties files: Use a comparison tool, for example,
Beyond Compare, Compare Suite, or Compare++, to compare the extracted
configuration files for each deployment environment.
- The ltpa.jceks file is a binary file for
LTPA keys and you cannot compare the contents.
