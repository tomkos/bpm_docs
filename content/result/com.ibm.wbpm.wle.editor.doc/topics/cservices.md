# Integrating services in the designer

For more information about the types of services that were created with the desktop
Process Designer, see Service types. For information on how to convert heritage services into
service flows, see Converting heritage services.

- Overview: Integrating external services

You can integrate many different external services in your workflows.
- Creating a service flow

A service flow is a sequence of services, gateways, and events. The Service Flow editor palette provides you with the tools to develop a simple or complex service flow that you can then use in your processes.
- Calling an external service

An external service is used to call an application or service on a system that is external to IBM Business Automation Workflow. The designer provides a discovery mechanism to find the service or application that you want, select the operations that you want, and generate the external service.  Many types of services are available, such as a Java service, a web service, a REST service, or an external implementation.
- Converting heritage services

Convert heritage services into service flows that you can model in the Process Designer. Heritage services are services that were created in previous releases with the desktop Process Designer.
