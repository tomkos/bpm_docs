# Managing work

- Completing work on tasks in the Work dashboard

The Work dashboard lists the tasks that you own and the tasks that are assigned to your team, which you can claim to work on. Open a task to claim it and complete the work that is needed.
- Completing work on process instances in the Processes dashboard

You start process instances from the Launch section in the navigation pane. Depending on the type of process, work continues automatically from one task to the next, or documents and activities are completed for the work to be completed.
- Managing work for teams with the Team Performance dashboard

If you are a team manager, you can manage the work of the teams that you are responsible for from the Team Performance dashboard in Process Portal.
