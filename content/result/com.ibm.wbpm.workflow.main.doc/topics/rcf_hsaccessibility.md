# Tips and keyboard shortcuts for the Process Designer

The following tips improve your efficiency in the Process Designer.

- To automatically wire a new node (such as an
activity, gateway, or event) into an existing sequence flow in a process, service flow, client-side
human service, or human service diagram, simply drag the new node from the palette and drop it onto
the connection between the existing source node and target node.
- If you delete a node with a single outgoing connection, the incoming
connections to the deleted node will automatically be reconnected to the target node of the deleted
node.
- To hide or show the library, click the Arrow icon () in Process Designer.
- To maximize the space available in the main canvas, resize the palette and the main canvas. To
hide the property manager, click the arrow under the main canvas.
- To move from one open library item to another, press the arrow keys or click the menu in the
window.
- To choose multiple items in a category, press and hold the Ctrl key
and then click each item.
- To prevent you from losing changes, unsaved changes are flagged with an asterisk next to the
item name in the editor toolbar.
- To learn how to capture your development progress in snapshots, see Creating snapshots, comparing, setting status, and validating.
- To use the library items from a toolkit, add a dependency to that toolkit, as described in Managing toolkit dependencies.
- To see updates that are made by other users, you can view concurrent activity as described in
Process Designer.
- To tag library items for easy access, follow the instructions
in Tagging library items.
- To move or copy library items from one process application to
another, follow the instructions in Copying, duplicating, moving, and reverting library items.
- To add and manage external files as part of your Business Automation Workflow project,
see Managing external files.

| Switch modes            | F9                   | Switch between the edition mode and navigation mode. Use the edition mode to author a process or service flow diagram by adding, removing, and connecting elements on the canvas. Use the navigation mode to move between diagram elements. The navigation mode has further modes, as described for the F8 key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Change navigation style | F8                   | Switch between the disconnected-node navigation and connected-node navigation. Use this shortcut only in the navigation mode. In the disconnected-node navigation, use the arrow keys to navigate through the nodes in your diagram, ignoring connections. You also use the disconnected-node navigation when you have disconnected nodes on your canvas. The nodes are traversed in the order in which they were created. In the connected-node navigation, use the arrow keys to navigate through connected nodes and their connections. You cannot navigate through disconnected nodes by using the connected-code navigation. |
| Open inline editor      | F2                   | Open the inline editor for the first editable label of the currently focused graphic element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Attach boundary event   | B                    | (Applicable to service nodes only) Attach an error boundary event to the boundary of a selected node.
