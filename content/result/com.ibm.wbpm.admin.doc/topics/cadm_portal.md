# Administering work portals

- Modifying runtime behavior

Several configuration and custom properties are available for you to modify the behavior of your work portals, Workplace or Process Portal. Depending on the type of change required, updates are made by using custom properties, mashup properties, wsadmin commands, or elements in the 100Custom.xml file.
- Configuring email for task notification assignment

Process Portal users can set their preferences to receive an email notification when a new task is assigned to them or their group. The configuration works for all types of email. To use this capability, you must enable the email environment to send notifications.
- Process Portal dashboards: Authorization overview

Process Portal includes a Process Performance and a Team Performance dashboard. Users must be authorized to access the dashboards and for the management actions that are available in each of the dashboards.
- Setting the order of the dashboards in Process Portal for a user group

To modify the default Process Portal dashboard order for users, use Bulk User Attribute Assignment in the Process Admin Console.
- Administering the federated data repository indexes

The federated data repository indexes used with Workplace significantly improve the search experience for business process definition (BPD) process instances, BPD tasks and case instances in both federated and nonfederated environments.
- Administering the Process Portal index

The Process Portal index allows process participants who are working in Process Portal in non-federated environments to search business processes for instance data. The index is also used to provide data for the charts in the Process Performance and Team Performance dashboards.
- Administering searches

By default, users can create, share, and save searches. But you can restrict creation and update permissions on saved searches by using action policies in nonfederated environments or user roles in federated environments.
- Tuning Process Portal searches

In nonfederated Business Automation Workflow environments, you can optimize saved searches and control search results by using acceleration tools or setting configuration properties.
- Configuring the My Team Performance dashboard for Process Portal (deprecated)

You can configure certain aspects of the My Team Performance dashboard, for example, which tasks are visible to team managers and the maximum number of tasks that is displayed in the task list.
- Configuring IBM Connections integration for task notifications (deprecated)

Process Portal users can set their preferences to receive a notification in IBM Connections when a new task is assigned to them. To use this capability, you must configure the integration with IBM Connections.
- Configuring Sametime Connect integration for Process Portal (deprecated)

IBM Lotus Sametime Connect provides instant messaging support to allow your users to collaborate in real time on their work. To integrate Sametime Connect functionality with Process Portal, you must perform additional configuration steps in both environments.
