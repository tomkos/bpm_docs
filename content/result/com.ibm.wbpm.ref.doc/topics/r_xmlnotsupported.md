# XML constructs not supported

Process Designer and
the interface of an Advanced Integration service and all data definitions
and interfaces in mirrored libraries in Integration Designer support
only a subset of the XML schema constructs. A list of XML schema constructs
that have limitations or are not supported are provided in the tables
later in this document.

- a data definition or interface is used as an interface of an Advanced
Integration service
- a data definition or interface is used by WSDL or XSD in a web
service integration

Ignoring any one of the development
time warnings that are provided in the tables is discouraged. Depending
on many factors, unrecoverable situations might occur at run time
in business processes that have been published ignoring these warnings.

These
same XSD constructs should not be imported through a BPMN 2 archive
file using IBM
WebSphereÂ® Business Modeler,
because in this case there is no validation but there are errors in
the log file.

Only IBM Business Process Manager
Advanced has
Advanced Integration services, but the limitations also apply to the
Standard and Express versions when you use a web service integration.
The limitations are a result of internal data model limitations that
also affect Process Designer.
For a description of errors and warnings that can occur, see Troubleshooting XML schema messages for web service integrations.

The
following tables list the errors and warning caused by the XML constructs
with limitations.

- Errors caused by XML schema constructs with limitations

## Errors caused by XML schema
constructs with limitations

The errors issued at development
time are in Integration Designer.

## Warnings caused by XML
schema constructs with limitations

The errors issued at
development time are in Integration Designer.

Your Advanced Integration
service interface and the interfaces in mirrored libraries should
only use business objects with supported XML schema constructs. If
you have business objects that use the previous elements, then you
need to mediate between these business objects and those on your Advanced
Integration service or in your mirrored libraries. This action can
be done using a mediation flow component and maps.
