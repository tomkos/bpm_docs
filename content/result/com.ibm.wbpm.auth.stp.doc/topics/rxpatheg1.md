# Example: Setting filters in XPath expressions

When a field is selected in the viewer, this section will
be populated with default values if an array field exists.  If no
array fields are found based on the selected field in the viewer,
this section will appear empty. It is important to note that this
section of the XPath Expression Builder will reset whenever the selection
changes in the field viewer.
