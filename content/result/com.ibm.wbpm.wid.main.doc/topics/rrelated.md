# Bidirectional support

IBMÂ® Integration
Designer works in a multilingual environment. This means it can display and manipulate data represented in different languages. The bidirectional language support for languages written from right to left is discussed in this section.

## Bidirectional support

Several
languages that have bidirectional scripts (for example Arabic or Hebrew)
require bidirectional support. Those languages are written from right
to left, while numbers and embedded segments of Latin (or Cyrillic
or Greek, and so on) text are embedded in this text from left to right.

In Overview of bidirectional script support in IBM Integration
Designer the
support for bidirectional languages is discussed including the configuration
required and some specific technical points when using the support
and limitations.
