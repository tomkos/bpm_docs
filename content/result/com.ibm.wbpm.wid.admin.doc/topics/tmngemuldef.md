# Managing emulator definition steps

## About this task

- Adding and running emulator definition steps for components

An emulator definition step for a component enables you to emulate a component or import for a specific test case and use the test data table to specify the expected input data and output response data.
- Adding and running emulator definition steps for references

An emulator definition step for a reference enables you to emulate a component reference for a specific test case and use the test data table to specify the expected input data and output response data.
- Adding and running emulator definition steps for inline human tasks

An emulator definition step for an inline human task enables you to emulate an inline human task for a specific test case and use the test data table to specify the expected input data and output response data. It also enables to you to claim and complete the human task automatically.
- Adding and running emulator definition steps for stand-alone human tasks

An emulator definition step for a stand-alone human task enables you to emulate a stand-alone human task for a specific test case and use the test data table to specify the expected input data and output response data. It also enables to you to claim and complete the human task automatically.
- Editing emulator definition steps for components and references

In the test suite editor, you can edit an emulator definition step for a component or reference and customize it for specific tests. For example, you can select a different interface and operation for the step.
- Editing emulator definition steps for human tasks

In the test suite editor, you can edit an emulator definition step for an inline or stand-alone human task and customize it for specific tests. For example, you can select a different interface and operation for the task.
- Running test suites with unmatched emulator definition steps

If a test suite contains two or more emulator definition steps for the same component, reference or human task and none of the emulator definition steps match, the test run will fail.
- Removing emulator definition steps

You can remove any emulator definition steps that are listed in the Test Cases area of the test suite editor. This enables you to more easily manage the remaining emulator definition steps.
