# Using the desktop IBM Process
Designer
(deprecated)

The main difference between the two editors is that you create and edit BPDs, services, and
heritage user interfaces in the desktop Process Designer, and you create and edit processes and
responsive user interfaces in the  Process Designer. There are artifacts such as business objects that you can edit in both.

- Double-click the IBM Process Designer Windows® desktop shortcut.
- Choose Start > IBM > IBM Process Designer from the Windows desktop.

In the Log In dialog, provide your Business Automation Workflow user name and password. If you do not already
have a user account, contact your Business Automation Workflow
administrator. When you log in, you are connected to the Workflow Center designated during the
installation of IBM Process Designer.

- Where to edit Process Designer artifacts

The desktop Process Designer is deprecated. Use the newer Process Designer in a browser unless you are updating artifacts that you can edit only in the traditional desktop Process Designer.
- Setting preferences in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
IBM® Process Designer provides several settings to control the appearance and functionality of the editors and interfaces that it includes.
