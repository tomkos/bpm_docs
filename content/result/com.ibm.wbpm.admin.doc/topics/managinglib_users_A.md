# Granting administrative access to the Workflow Center repository

## About this task

The best way to manage access to Workflow Center and
its repository is by using groups. You can add preexisting groups
of users from your external user repository to tw\_admins,
which is an Business Automation Workflow group
whose members have administrative access to the repository by default.

- Business Automation Workflow internal
groups created in the Process Admin console.
- The user repository that was configured for the Business Automation Workflow environment.

## Procedure

To grant administrative access to the Workflow Center repository:

1. In Workflow Center,
click the Admin option.
2. Select the Manage Users option.
3. Find the user or group to which you want to grant administrative
access, and then enable the Admin option for
that user or group.

## Results

- Ability to manage user access to the entire Workflow Center repository
- Administrative permissions on all process applications and toolkits
- Ability to edit Workflow Center settings
such as offline servers or a connected Workflow Center
