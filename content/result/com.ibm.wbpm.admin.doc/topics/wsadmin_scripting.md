# Administrative commands (AdminTasks)

In a network deployment environment, an
application cluster member runs the Workflow Server and Workflow Center applications.
Therefore, you must run these wsadmin commands on the node that contains
that application cluster member. Do not run the commands from the
deployment manager profile.

All wsadmin commands for managing process applications must
be run in connected mode and the server must be running. Use the -contype argument
to indicate what connection type you want to use (SOAP or RMI). See Using the wsadmin scripting tool in the WebSphere
Application Server documentation for detailed instructions.

In the following syntax examples, myHostName.mycompany.com is
the host name of the server that is configured for Workflow Server or
for the Workflow Center server.
Make sure to substitute your own port, host name, user name, and password
when you are creating a connection.

```
wsadmin -conntype SOAP -port 8880 -host myHostName.mycompany.com -user admin -password admin -lang jython

AdminTask.taskName('[options ]')
```
