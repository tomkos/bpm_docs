When you are defining a new project area for development environment or a target environment for
a production environment, you need to configure case integration against the object store that is

Configuration tool against the connection definition that is associated with the project area or
target environment.

1. Start the Case configuration tool and open the profile that is
associated with the environment.  Refer to Preparing to run the case configuration tasks to know how to run the Case Configuration tool and loading a profile.
2. Edit the Configure Case Integration with IBM Business Automation
Workflow task.
3. Select the connection definition that is associated with the project area, and verify the
rest of the settings for the workflow environment.
4. Run the task.
