<h1>Translating custom strings</h1>

<h2>Before you begin</h2>

<p>Deploy the solution before you translate the customized
string. When you deploy the solution, the nls/Resources.js file
is created or modified in the IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow/Solutions/solution_name folder
in the design object store or staging object store.</p>

<p>The recommended best practice is to treat all translated custom
string resources like other solution assets. Those assets should be
tested and maintained in a design object store in the development
environment first. Then, you move those assets to a production environment,
which means that all available translated custom string resources
are moved to the staging object store in the test environment. Finally,
you move the complete translated solution to a production environment,
which uses the design object store.</p>

<p>Although this procedure
takes longer for the translated strings to be available in a production
environment, it is the best way to  maintain the solution definition,
the generated default language resources, and any other manually translated
custom string resources.</p>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<ul>
<li>Page titles</li>
<li>Action labels and menu labels in widgets</li>
<li>Title for the tabbed layout, title for the titled layout, custom
property label, and property hint in views.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To translate a custom string:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using IBM Content
Navigator, browse to the
design_or_staging_object_store_name/IBM Business Automation
Workflow/Solutions/solution_name/nls
folder.</li>
<li>Download the Resources.js file.</li>
<li>Create your target locale directory in the original directory.
For example, if your target locale is French, create the
following directory: design_or_staging_object_store_name/IBM Business Automation
Workflow/Solutions/solution_name/nls/fr.
The locale values are case sensitive. Use hyphen separators instead of underscores in the
locale values. For example, specify en-us instead of
en_us. If your solution locale is French and you want to translate the
solution to English, use locale en.</li>
<li>Edit the downloaded Resources.js file.
Change the value for the custom string to the translated value for
your locale.
For example, change the English value for
a customized page title: "New Work": "New Work" to
a localized title: "New Work":"Nouveau Travail"</li>
</ol>

<p>Attention: The encoding of the Resources.js file
must be set to UTF-8 or UTF-8 without BOM.
5. Make the same changes for any other customized strings
that you want to translate.
6. Add the translated Resources.js file
to the design_or_staging_object_store_name/IBM Business Automation
Workflow/Solutions/solution_name/nls/fr folder
as a document of Document class and as a major version. The document
title must be Resources.js.
7. Repeat these steps for each language you want to translate
to.
8. Redeploy the solution.</p>
