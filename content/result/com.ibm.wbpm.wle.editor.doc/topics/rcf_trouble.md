# Troubleshooting errors from running client-side human services

If the diagnostic information in the browser console is insufficient, check the log and trace
information in the SystemOut.log and trace.log files, and
contact your system administrator for extra help. Depending on what error occurred, the system
administrator can take different approaches to help resolve the error. For more
information, see the IBM Business Automation Workflow log files.

## Certificate errors and
the client-side human services playback

Signer certificate
errors might occur when you use HTTPs but have not imported your signer
certificates. This may lead to inconsistent playback behavior. To
avoid certificate errors in the browser and ensure an error-free environment
for your playback sessions, import the signer certificates before
proceeding with the playback. Check with your administrator for instructions
on how to import the signer certificates.
