# Upgrading and converting case solutions

## Before you begin

When you design and create a solution, you must decide what the
solution locale is. The solution locale refers to the locale of display names for case properties,
case types, tasks, and other solution artifacts that you create with Case Builder. When you deploy an
upgraded solution to a target environment for the first time, you must deploy the solution under the
same locale to ensure that the display names are preserved.

## About this task

After you installed or upgraded IBM Business Automation
Workflow, open each solution in
Case Builder. You can access
Case Builder either from
Workflow Center for promoted
solutions or from the classic Case Builder for solutions that are not
promoted.

After you click the icon to upgrade the solution, Case Builder updates the solution for
use.

For each solution that you upgrade, you must also specify security settings for the solution
folder. Ensure that only users who have permission to view the solution folder can work with the
solution in Case Client.

After the solution is upgraded, commit any changes to the solution and redeploy the solution.

- Upgrading solutions in Case Builder

Upgrading a solution in Case Builder automatically updates the solution definition files, enables new features, and generates a web application for the solution.
