<h1>Favorites and sync features are not supported for IBM Business Automation</h1>

<p>Workflow documents from repositories other than IBM
FileNet P8</p>

<p>IBM Business Automation
Workflow reuses the favorites and sync features from IBM Content
Navigator. These features are not supported, however, for documents that
are in external repositories. An external repository is a repository other than
FileNet P8 that was originally configured for IBM Business Automation
Workflow.</p>

<p>For example, for an IBM Content
Manager repository, the IBM Content
Navigator Administration Console does not show the Sync enabling feature
for configuration. The feature is only available for enabling on FileNet P8 repositories. Normally, the feature is enabled on the target
object store where the solution is deployed.</p>
