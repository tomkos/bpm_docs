# SLASTATUS view

SLA roll-ups occur periodically to calculate the current state
of SLAs based on information in the SLATHRESHOLDTRAVERSALS view.
Roll-ups are necessary because many SLA conditions are based on ranges
such as the last N days or in the last 2
weeks. Business Automation Workflow tracks
a new value any time any of the following values change.

The SLASTATUS view includes the following
columns:

| Column              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INTERIM             | This is either Y or N. An SLA status value is interim if it comes from the middle of a condition other than a range. A range is something like the last 5 occurrences or in the last 3 weeks. A non-range condition is something like today. If you have an SLA based on the sum of some metric today, then you want to be able to see the interim values during the day, however when plotting a graph you'd really want to see only the sum at the end of the day. SLAs with non-range conditions always track a non-interim value at the end of the window. |
| SLA\_VALUE           | The current value of the SLA. This value is only meaningful for SLAs with conditions like SUM(X) over today, in which case the value will hold that sum. In most other cases, this column holds the METRIC\_VALUE as of the last traversal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| VIOLATION\_LEVEL     | The violation level of the SLA as follows: a value between 0.0 and 1.0 = unviolated; a value greater than or equal to 1.0 = violated. Wherever possible, the violation level is set to a value greater than 1.0 to indicate how violated the SLA is. For example, if an SLA measures whether 3 of the last 10 conditions were violated, and 6 of the last 10 conditions were violated, then the violation level would be 2.0.                                                                                                                                  |
