<h1>Container width and height</h1>

<p>When you first open a view in Properties View Designer, the canvas contains a single layout
container. This container is the root container in which you add other containers and
properties.</p>

<p>Each container is as wide as its parent container if a width and height is not specified. You can
set a custom width.</p>

<p>The default height is determined by the content of the container. You can override the default
height by setting the height to a specific percentage or number of pixels. If you set the container
to a specific height (percentage), you must also set a specific height for the parent container or
containers, including the root container. If the height of the content exceeds the specified height,
a vertical scroll bar is displayed.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Tabbed Layout container always fills the full width of the container unless an explicit
height and width are specified.</li>
<li>All tab panes within the container have the same width regardless of their explicit width
settings.</li>
<li>The height can be set for the tab container or for the individual tab panes within the
container.</li>
<li><p>If the content of a tab pane exceeds the specified width and height of the tab container,
horizontal or vertical scroll bars are displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Titled Layout container expands to the height of its content. When the container is
collapsed, the height is reduced to the height of the title bar.</p></li>
<li><p>If an explicit height is specified, the container height is always that height. When the
container is collapsed, the content is hidden but the height is not reduced.</p></li>
<li><p>The default width for each container is an equal percentage of the parent container.</p></li>
<li>When you override any column settings, the default settings are discarded and you must specify
the settings for all columns.</li>
<li><p>If the total column width exceeds the container width, a horizontal scroll bar is
displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Labels have the width equal to the longest label in the list.</p></li>
<li>The column for the editor gets the remaining width.</li>
<li>A field width percentage is the percentage of the editor column.</li>
<li><p>The field width can be specified for each property. If a width is not specified, a default width
is used.</p></li>
<li><p>You can specify the width of the table. If the combined column width exceeds the container
width, a horizontal scroll bar is displayed.</p></li>
<li>You can specify the height of the table. If the height is not specified, the table increases in
height without a limit. If a height is specified, the table height is fixed and a vertical scroll
bar is displayed in the table as necessary.</li>
<li>You can specify the field width for each property. If a width is not specified, a default width
is selected. Percentage-based field widths are specified as a percentage of the table width.</li>
</ul>
