A shallow function looks only at that information which is on the first level of the BO. If the BO contains a reference to another BO, then that information will not be considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| SCA services         | create XML string from BO                           | Creates an XML string that contains the contents of a business object. It does this by adding a CDATA tag around the BO XML string. The CDATA tag can cause a JDBC adapter to send encoded XML to the database. To make sure the XML string is not encoded and to not store the CDATA tag with the message, use a combination of the get BOXMLSerializer Service Standard snippet and the BOXMLSerializer.writeDataObject Java snippet to create an XML string that contains the contents of a business object.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
