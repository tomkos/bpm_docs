# Planning for IBM Business Automation Workflow

- Assessing your requirements

To minimize rework and outages, take the time to study your current environment before you make installation and configuration decisions. Consider your current business requirements and design, the hardware and software already installed, and your current strengths and shortcomings. This planning could also help you minimize your financial investment.
- Choosing typical or custom installation

Choose the typical installation option to install IBM Business Automation Workflow interactively in environments for development, quality assurance, and single-cluster staging and test. Choose the custom installation option for production environments. You must also choose custom to install silently, if you will be installing on an existing WebSphereÂ® Application Server, or if your business requires more than a single cluster.
- Choosing the deployment environment type

When you configure IBM Business Automation Workflow, you must choose your deployment environment type: IBM Workflow Center or IBM Workflow Server, and Advanced, Standard, or AdvancedOnly.
- Planning your network deployment environment

Setting up a network deployment environment involves many decisions, such as the number of physical workstations and the type of pattern you choose. Each decision affects how you set up your deployment environment.
- Security considerations

Security is an integral consideration when you are planning to install IBM Business Automation Workflow, when you are developing and deploying applications, and in the day-to-day running of IBM Business Automation Workflow.
- Planning your database configuration

To plan your database configuration, you must know which databases must be established and configured to use the software, which components of IBM Business Automation Workflow you will use and their associated databases, the tasks required to administer the databases, and the security privileges of the database system that you are using.
