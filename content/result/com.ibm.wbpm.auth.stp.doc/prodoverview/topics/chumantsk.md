# Human tasks

Occasionally, people need to intervene in a business process. For
example, a customer wants to purchase an item that is above his credit
limit. You can use a human task to intervene and override a business
rule that prevents the customer from making the purchase. A human
task can have attributes, such as setting the owner of the task, and
providing an escalation process if specified task owner is not available.
Many processes require human intervention for tasks such as reviewing,
researching, and approving.

A human task cannot be used in a mediation module.
