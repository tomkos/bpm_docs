# Managing events

- Maintaining and monitoring IBM Business Automation Workflow Event Manager

You can use the Event Manager monitor that is included in the Process Admin Console to troubleshoot processes that are supposed to run automatically (for example through an undercover agent) but fail to start. You can use the Event Manager monitor to identify underlying problems as well as controlling various aspects of Event Manager processing.
- Working with failed events in IBM Business Automation Workflow

 If an event fails, it is stored in a database in the failed events manager. Use the failed event manager to search for and handle failed events.
- Preventing multiple failed events when a service is unavailable

If your component calls a service, and that service is unavailable, a runtime error occurs. Events associated with the error are treated, by default, as failed events. Using the store-and-forward feature, however, you can drastically reduce the number of failed events that are generated by the system.
- Managing locks on sequenced events

The lock manager handles event sequencing locks. You can use the esAdmin command to list, delete, or unlock any lock in the lock manager.
- Capturing Business Automation Workflow events for external consumption

To collect events, perhaps for auditing reasons, you can configure the Dynamic Event Framework (DEF) and subscribe to events that you want to receive.
