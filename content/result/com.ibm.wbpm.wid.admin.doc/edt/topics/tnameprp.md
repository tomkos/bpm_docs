# Renaming properties in event definitions

In the event definition editor, you can rename any of the
properties in an event definition. If you rename a property and it
has the same name and path as a property in the parent event definition
or in any higher-level parent in the same inheritance hierarchy, then
the renamed property will override the property of the parent.
