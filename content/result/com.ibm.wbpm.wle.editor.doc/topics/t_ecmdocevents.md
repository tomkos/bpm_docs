# Inbound events from Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems

## About this task

- Runtime behavior for inbound content events

To work with inbound content events, you should understand the two key concepts of runtime behavior: the event source ID and the filtering and processing of event subscriptions.
- Performing modeling tasks for inbound events

To receive information about inbound content events that originate from changes to documents or folders on Enterprise Content Management (ECM) servers, you need to use Process Designer to perform the modeling tasks of creating and configuring components that can detect and respond to the content events.
- Performing administrative tasks for inbound events

To receive information about inbound document and folder events that originate on Enterprise Content Management (ECM) servers, you need to perform the administrative tasks of developing and installing an event handler on your ECM system. The event handler notifies the Business Automation Workflow system about ECM events by calling the appropriate APIs.
