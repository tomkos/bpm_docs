# Configuring an external Content Platform Engine

After creating your deployment environment, you can configure IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow to work with an existing external Content Platform Engine system by using new object stores.

If you created your deployment environment using the
BPMConfig command with the property template file in
install\_root/BPM/samples/config/externalcpe, the internal Content Platform Engine and embedded document store were not
configured.

## About this task

- You have an existing Content Platform Engine that you want
to use with IBM Business Automation Workflow.
- You want to keep artifacts such as documents and cases that will persist longer than six
months.
- You intend to use Content Platform Engine for documents
besides cases and processes.
- You plan to use case management heavily.
