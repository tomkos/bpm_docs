# Adding users to a project area

## About this task

Each development environment
has a default project area
named dev\_env\_connection\_definition. You must add at least one user
to the default project area before you can use Case Builder. You can define more
project areas as needed to provide isolated work areas for developing
and testing solutions in Case Builder.
To access a project area, you can move users and user groups from
one project area to another as needed. You can add users in user groups
to the default project area, but you can add only individual users
to a nondefault project area. A user can belong only to one nondefault
project area and the default project area.

Before you add users
to the project area, add them to the master group that you configured
for access to your object store.

You can add users to project areas by using the Case administration client. Select the default project area, click Actions > View and Edit, and click the Security tab to add users. For more
information, see Managing project areas.
