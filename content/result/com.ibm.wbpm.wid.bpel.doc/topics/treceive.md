# Assigning roles to your human task

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Launch your human task in the editor. The display
that you see will depend on what kind of human task you are working
with. For example, there will already be a few roles selected, and
the display for the people assignment settings will differ as such:

Kind of task
People assignment display 

To-do 
Receiver

In this case, you will be configuring the roles for the people who will be able to claim and work on this task.

Invocation 
Originator

In this case, you will be configuring the roles for the people who will be able to initiate the task.

Collaboration 
Both receiver and originator

Since a collaboration task is assigned to one person from another, it has both receiver and originator settings. See above for descriptions of each.
2. To add another role to this task, click the  icon and
select one from the drop down list. The drop down list
will only show those roles that are still available to be chosen.
Here is a list and a description of each of the roles that you will
be able to work with:
Table 1. Available roles and their descriptions

Role (icon)
Description

Administrators 
Administrators have the authority to perform
higher level duties like suspend, terminate, restart, force-retry,
and force-complete.

Potential creators 
Potential creators can create an instance of
the human task, but cannot start it.

Potential starters 
Potential starters have the authority to initiate
an existing instance. The starter role is subtly different from that
of creator, and although a creator can create a new instance, only
a starter can start it. In many usage scenarios, the same employee
fulfils both roles. This role is only associated with an invocation
task.

Potential owners 
Potential owners can claim, work on and complete
tasks. Ownership can be Single or Parallel. See the related topic
on Ownership Patterns for more information.

Editors 
Editors can work with the content of a task,
but cannot claim or complete it. For example, an editor can receive
the work item to review a document and add comments, but an editor
is not able to finish the task. 

Readers 
Readers are allowed to view tasks, but cannot
work on them. This role can be used in situations where an employee
wants to monitor as task without taking any action in it.
3. To remove an existing role, select it in the table, and
click .
4. In the Assign People tab of the
properties area, use the people assignment criteria settings to specify
which people should belong to the role in question.
