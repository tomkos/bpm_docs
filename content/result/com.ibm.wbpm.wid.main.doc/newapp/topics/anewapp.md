# Working with projects and modules

If you are a new user of IBM® Integration
Designer, you must learn several introductory concepts and tasks. For example, you must learn about the workspace and the Business Integration perspective, and how to see your project in a context with other projects.

In the first topics in this section, you can learn about the workspace and the Business Integration perspective, where you will do most of your work in IBM Integration
Designer. You can learn about business integration projects, such as modules, mediation modules, and libraries, and about implementations, which provide the integration logic for components. You can learn how to create modules, libraries, mediation modules, and the components that form their building blocks.

In the later topics in this section, you can learn how to see your
project in context with other projects, how to work with mediation
modules, and how to work with Java™ and Java components.

- Workspaces

An Eclipse workspace is a collection of projects and other physical resources that you are currently developing in the workbench. Additional information about these resources resides in a directory on the file system. The resources might reside in the same directory.
- Creating modules and libraries

When you build integrated business solutions with IBM Integration Designer, you will create modules, mediation modules, and libraries to contain the resources and code.
- Organizing projects using integration solutions

An integration solution is a non-deployable project that is solely used to reference other projects in the workspace, such as modules, mediation modules, libraries, component test projects, Java projects, and simple projects. Integration solutions help you organize groups of related projects and more easily perform common actions on the projects, such as sharing them in a team environment. When you create a new integration solution, an integration solution diagram is automatically generated. You can open the integration solution diagram in the integration solution editor and view the relationships between the related projects that are referenced in the integration solution.
- Creating and wiring components

You can build applications by assembling the SCA components. Components form the individual elements of the applications that are in your process. The following tasks describe how you can add and wire components together.
- Working with implementations

In IBM Integration Designer, a component implementation consists of the business logic that is executed when the component is opened, because it implements the interfaces and references. When you work with the assembly editor, you can add new components and use the Generate Implementation action to automatically create implementations and open them for editing.
- Adding notes

You can use notes to add reminders or development notes. A note can remind you of further development that needs to be done.
- Setting assembly editor preferences

You can use the Preferences window to modify the assembly editor settings for its layout and wiring prompts.
- Finding errors in the assembly diagram

In the Business Integration view, you can use the Problems view to see error messages such as assembly diagram error messages.
- Assembling services: Customer enquiry example

This example shows how you can assemble a service to process a customer enquiry.
