# Cannot add values to multi value properties

## Symptoms

## Causes

Because the property view was designed with a multi value property that is displayed at the
bottom of the page, the OK button on the data entry window is hidden.

## Resolving the problem

- Resize the browser window in the vertical direction.
- If the properties widget or browser window contains a vertical scroll bar, scroll down.
