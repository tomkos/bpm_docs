# Managing test traces

## About this task

- Saving test traces in the integration test client

When you run a test in the integration test client, the events that occur in your test are recorded in a test trace. When you have finished running your test, you can save the test trace to a test trace file. You can later load the test trace into the integration test client and rerun the test.
- Loading test traces for the integration test client

You can load any test trace for the integration test client that you earlier saved in a test trace file. This enables you to renew a test session at the point in a test when you saved the test trace.
- Deleting test trace files

You can delete one or more test trace files that contain your saved test traces. This enables you to more easily manage the remaining test trace files.
