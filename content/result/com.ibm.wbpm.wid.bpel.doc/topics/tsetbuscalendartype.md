Integration and click Calendar.
2 From the Calendar type drop-downlist, select the type of calendar you want. The choices availableare:
    1. Gregorian (default): This internationally
accepted civil calendar provides a close approximation to the tropical
year, which is the actual length of time it takes for Earth to make
one orbit of the sun.
    2. Hijri (civil): The Hijri (or
Islamic) date in this calendar is based on arithmetic rules.
    3. Hijri (religious): The Hijri
(or Islamic) date in this calendar is based on astronomical calculations.
3. From the First day of the week drop-down
list, select the day that starts the week. The default. is Sunday
4. Click Apply and OK to
make your calendar type selection active. If you have an editor open,
close and open it again to have its contents in sync with the new
calendar type.

Currently, support for calendar types like the Hijri calendar is only within IBMÂ® Integration
Designer; that is, it is not supported in the runtime environment.
