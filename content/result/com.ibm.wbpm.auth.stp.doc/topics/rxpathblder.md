# XPath Expression Builder

The XPath Expression Builder is available in various editors.
You can typically open it by clicking Edit in
the Properties view of an artifact.

Type your XPath expression
directly in the text box. If you are new to XPath, click Insert Simple XPath to open the Simple XPath Expression
Builder, which guides you through building an XPath expression. You
can also insert a simple XPath expression into an expression already
in the text box. The expression that you build with the Simple XPath
Expression Builder is inserted at the current cursor location in the
text box.
