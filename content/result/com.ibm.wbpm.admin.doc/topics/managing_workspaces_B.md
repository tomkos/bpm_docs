# Creating branches

## Before you begin

## About this task

If project contains Business Automation Workflow advanced content, before
you create branches ensure that projects are brought into IBM Integration
Designer so you can create the
default library and module. For information about the known limitations of
working with advanced content in Workflow Center, see Limitations when working with process applications and toolkits.

## Procedure

To create branches in the classic Workflow Center, complete the following steps:

1. Select the Process apps or Toolkits tab.
2. Select the project you want to create a new branch for.
3. If a snapshot doesn't exist, click Main and then Create a
snapshot.
4. Select the menu of the snapshot and select New branch.

Note: The New branch option is available only if an administrator enabled
branches for the project.
5. Enter a name and, optionally, a description, and click Save. 
When you create a branch, Workflow Center displays a drop-down
menu for the project that enables you to select the branch that you want.Note: An acronym is
automatically generated for the branch. The acronym for the new branch is derived from the first
character of each word in the branch name. For example, if the branch name is My New
Branch, an acronym of MNT is automatically generated. The acronym is used
to differentiate multiple versions of a project. For more information, see Naming conventions.
6. To open the new branch in the Designer view in IBM Process
Designer, click Open <name
of branch> in Designer.
