# WebSphere MQ Java Message Service (MQ JMS)

The JMS API is an open standard API for sending and receiving
messages. It allows components based on Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to create, send, receive, and read messages.
Using this standard makes your MQ applications more portable and allows
your MQ applications to use different JMS implementations for different
circumstances. In MQ JMS, both the point-to-point and publish-subscribe
distribution of messages are supported unlike MQ, which is limited
to point-to-point.

This section leads you through the generation of an MQ JMS import
and export binding.

- WebSphere MQ JMS programming model

The WebSphere MQ JMS programming model is discussed in this section.
- MQ and MQ JMS features

Several features of MQ and MQ JMS bindings and how SCA artifacts work with them are discussed.
- Working with MQ JMS bindings

MQ JMS bindings can be generated for imports and exports with either a one-way operation or request-response operation. All cases are discussed in this section.
- Creating applications with MQ JMS bindings

Building applications that use MQ JMS bindings are shown in this section.
- Limitations of the JMS, MQ JMS and generic JMS bindings

The JMS and MQ JMS bindings have some limitations.
