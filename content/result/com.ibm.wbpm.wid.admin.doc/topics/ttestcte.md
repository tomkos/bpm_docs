# Testing with the Component Test Explorer

## About this task

Using the Component Test Explorer, you can:

- Query and display component test projects, test suites, and test
cases that have been deployed on the server.
- Select and run one or more component test projects, test suites,
or test cases and then display and automatically save the results.
- Schedule specific times to automatically run one or more component
test projects, test suites, or test cases.

Additionally, the Component Test Explorer enables you to:

- Define global server-wide emulators for component and import interfaces
deployed on the server.
- Specify global server-wide rules to automatically process and
claim human tasks deployed on the server.

The following topics describe the key concepts and tasks in
using the Component Test Explorer for managing and running test cases:

- Overview

The Component Test Explorer is a fully functional component test environment that features a web interface. Using the Component Test Explorer, you can manage and run component tests as well as globally emulate human tasks and module components.
- Component Test Explorer

The web interface of Component Test Explorer allows you to create, run and schedule tests.
- Starting Component Test Explorer

Component Test Explorer is packaged as a Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition application that can be deployed and started using IBM Integration Designer.
- Running test projects, suites, and cases in the Component Test Explorer

In the Test Cases page, you can view and run component test projects, test suites, and test cases that are deployed on the server.
- Scheduling tests in the Component Test Explorer

Using the Scheduler page, you can schedule tests to run at a particular time. If necessary, you can schedule the tests to run repeatedly.
- Defining global emulators in the Component Test Explorer

Using the Component Emulators page, you can define a global emulator for any component in any module on the system. This enables you to globally emulate a component that is not yet available but is needed for testing. It also enables you to globally emulate a component that is available for testing but has not yet been implemented.
- Emulating human tasks in the Component Test Explorer

The Human Task Emulators page is similar to the Component Emulators page. You choose the element to emulate and then specify the emulation rules.
