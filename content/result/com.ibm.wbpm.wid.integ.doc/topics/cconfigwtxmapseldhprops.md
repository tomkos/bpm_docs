# Configuring the WTX map selection data handler properties

This table lists the properties that can be configured on the WTX
map selection data handler you created previously when you made the
predefined WTX Map Selection Data Handler selection. These properties
are used in conjunction to determine the WTX map name invoked at run
time. This allows the client and server implementation to be loosely
coupled and highly reusable.

| BusinessObject       | This is the data type of the incoming data such as Customer, Order and so on.  The value of this property is used in the regular expression defined by XMLToNative Map Name and NativeToXML Map Name properties to derive the map name.                                                                                                                       | Implicit                                 | Implicit as the default value implies that the value of this property is the parameter type on the operation. For example: operation = create(Customer customerBO) then the value is Customer. This enables the user to specify the data binding at only one level on the export/import instead of on every operation. |
| ContentType          | This is the content type of the incoming data. For example, EDI, SWIFT, HL7 and so on.. The value of this property is used in the regular expression defined by properties XMLToNative Map Name and NativeToXML Map Name to derive the map name.                                                                                                              | None                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| XMLToNative Map Name | This property is the qualified map name for the map that converts data object to native data. The value of this property is a regular expression that is constructed with the properties BusinessObject and ContentType. The map directory is with respect to the SCA module. This value can also be hard coded to a map name although it is not recommended. | WTX/$(BusinessObject)XMLTo$(ContentType) | WTX is the default directory.  If the BusinessObject = "Customer" and ContentType = "EDI", the map name would be WTX/CustomerXMLToEDI                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| NativeToXML Map Name | This property is the qualified map name for the map that converts native data to data object. The value of this property is a regular expression that is constructed with the properties BusinessObject and ContentType. The map directory is with respect to the SCA module. This value can also be hard coded to a map name although it is not recommended. | WTX/$(BusinessObject)$(ContentType)ToXML | WTX is the default directory.  If the BusinessObject = "Customer" and ContentType = "EDI", the map name would be WTX/CustomerEDIToXML                                                                                                                                                                                  |
