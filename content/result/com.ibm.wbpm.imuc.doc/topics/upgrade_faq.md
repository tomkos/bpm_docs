Business Automation Workflow continues to
provide the same capabilities that you had with Case Manager and adds
additional tools to make things easier. Your case solutions still appear unchanged in the IBM Content
Navigator-hosted
Case Client. Case Builder is now part of the more
advanced Workflow Center
where your existing and future case and process projects are created, managed, tested, and prepared
for deployment to production environments.

## Migration related

- Using the case configuration tool, as described in the topic Upgrading your IBM Case Manager system using an external IBM Content Navigator. If your custom widget references any Case JavaScript APIs, you
must make the changes that are described in this topic.
- Manually update your deployed application to run on the same server.

## Case Analyzer

- If you upgrade from Case Manager V5.3.3, you
might already have the Case Analyzer components that are bundled with Business Automation Workflow. No additional upgrade is
needed for Case Analyzer.

than V5.3.3, you must install the Case Analyzer components that are bundled
with Business Automation Workflow.
