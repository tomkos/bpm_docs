<h1>Creating new case layouts using human services</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>A case page is the user interface that displays when you open a case solution or an artifact such
as a task or a case. You can build new human service-based pages or transition some of your existing
case pages to use client-side human services. You can use the adapter pages in Case Client to display both client-side
human service views and case widgets in the same page. See Adapter pages.</p>

<p>To create your case pages using human services, you can either use a default page layout or
create a custom page layout.</p>

<p>For more information, see Creating user interfaces for business processes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a default human service page layout</li>
</ul>

<p>The easiest way to create your case user interface is to use default page layouts. To use client-side human services to create your page, you must change the default widget-based page layouts to human service-based page layouts.
- Creating a custom case page using human services</p>

<p>You can customize your case pages using client-side human services to meet the requirements of your case solution. Use custom layouts as templates to provide customized views for different roles, case types, and activities.
- Adding case widgets to a client-side human service page</p>

<p>You can display both client-side human service views and case widgets in the same page in Case Client by editing a custom case layout page in Page Designer.</p>
