# Modeling subprocesses

A subprocess represents a collection of logically related steps contained within a parent
process. You can view a subprocess as a single activity, providing a simplified, high-level view of
the parent process, or you can drill into the subprocess for a more detailed view of its
contents.

A subprocess can be embedded within another subprocess. To drill down into a collapsed subprocess
and view the contents, double-click the subprocess activity in the parent. To go back to the parent
process from within a subprocess or event subprocess, use the navigation in the upper left corner of
the diagram. To return to a parent process from a linked process, use the menu above the canvas.

Subprocesses can contain swimlanes that are distinct from the parent process. For example,
activities in your subprocess can be carried out by a set of participants that is different from the
set of participants that carry out the activities in the parent process.

Like other activities, subprocesses can be configured to run multiple times within the execution
of the parent process by configuring looping behavior on the subprocess activity element in the
parent process.

The following describes the types of subprocesses that you can model in a process, and their
characteristics.

- Modeling non-reusable subprocesses

A subprocess is a logical collection of activities that exists only within its parent process. Grouping related process elements in a subprocess simplifies the view of the process. A subprocess hides the complexity of individual step details until the subprocess activity is opened.
- Working with linked processes

A process can call another process through a linked process activity. When the linked process activity is triggered at run time, the linked process is run. After the linked process is completed, the parent process resumes execution. When you group together related activities in a separate process, instead of in a subprocess, you can reuse that process in other processes that share that set of activities. For example, the steps for creating a customer account might be common to several different processes. If you group these steps together in a Create Customer Account process, you can use linked process activities to call this process from all processes that require it.
- Modeling event subprocesses

Event subprocesses are triggered by an event that occurs in the parent process. Event subprocesses are similar to other subprocesses in that they are contained within a parent process, and are not reusable outside of that process. They are unlike other subprocesses in that they are not connected to other activities in the process by incoming or outgoing connections, but are instead triggered by an event or timer.
