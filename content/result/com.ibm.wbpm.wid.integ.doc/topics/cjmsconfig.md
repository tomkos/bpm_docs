# Prepackaged JMS data format transformations

A description of each prepackaged data transformation follows in
this table.

If you intend to use the standard JMS message class with a body
type containing the message then you must use the business objects
provided for these body types. To create these business objects, a
predefined resource is available. To add this predefined resource,
expand your module and then double-click Dependencies.
The Dependencies editor opens. Expand Predefined Resources and
select Native Body Schema for Native Body DataHandler.
Save your work. You should also read Working with the simple JMS data bindings).

| JAXB-based Java™ code           | This data format transformation serializes Java code to a business object using the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) specification receiving a message and deserializes a business object to Java code using the JAXB specification when sending a message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | No                       |
| Service Gateway Data Handler    | The data format transformation uses the messageType property to determine which JMS body type will be used. The body type - BytesBody, ObjectBody, MapBody, StreamBody and TextBody - identifies the data format transformation to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No                       |
| JSON                            | This data format transformation sends and receives a business object based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) from the JMS client. This data format transformation must be configured. See json.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | No                       |
| Serialized Java Object          | This data format transformation sends and receives the business object, whose underlying implementation is a service data object (SDO) in a JMS object message, to and from the JMS client. This serialization type is preferred when dealing with other SOA components using JMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Yes                      |
| Simple JMS Message Data Binding | This data format transformation does not have a message body. It can be used to notify the JMS client of an event or to send some simple data in the message headers or properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | No                       |
| Wrapped Bytes                   | This data format transformation sends and receives the BytesBody business object in a BytesMessage message body to the client. The message body type is a byte array. Though still supported, a preferred method would be to use the data format transformations added when you select the Native Body schema for Native Body DataHandler in the Predefined Resources as stated in the introduction to this table.                                                                                        | No                       |
| Wrapped MapEntry                | This data format transformation sends and receives the MapBody business object in a MapMessage message body to the client. The message body type is a set of name/value pairs that can be addressed by name. The data type of the value is a Java primitive. Though still supported, a preferred method would be to use the data format transformations added when you select the Native Body schema for Native Body DataHandler in the Predefined Resources as stated in the introduction to this table. | No                       |
| Wrapped Object                  | This data format transformation sends and receives the ObjectBody business object in an ObjectMessage message body to the client. The message body type is a serialized Java Object. Though still supported, a preferred method would be to use the data format transformations added when you select the Native Body schema for Native Body DataHandler in the Predefined Resources as stated in the introduction to this table.                                                                         | No                       |
| Wrapped StreamMessage           | This data format transformation sends and receives the StreamBody business object in a StreamMessage message body to the client. The message body type is a stream of Java primitives. Though still supported, a preferred method would be to use the data format transformations added when you select the Native Body schema for Native Body DataHandler in the Predefined Resources as stated in the introduction to this table.                                                                       | No                       |
| Wrapped Text                    | This data format transformation sends and receives the TextBody business object to the TextMessage body of the client. Though still supported, a preferred method would be to use the data format transformations added when you select the Native Body schema for Native Body DataHandler in the Predefined Resources as stated in the introduction to this table.                                                                                                                                       | No                       |
| SOAP                            | The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) data format transformation parses the body of a SOAP message into a business object when receiving a message. It serializes a business object and places it in the body of a SOAP message when sending a message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Yes                      |
| XML                             | This data format transformation takes an XML data format as input and transforms it to a business object. It takes a business object output and transforms it to an XML data format. All character encoding sets (CCSIDs) are supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Yes                      |
| UTF8XMLDataHandler              | This data format transformation parses UTF-8 encoded XML data into a business object when receiving a message. It serializes a business object into UTF-8 encoded XML data when sending a message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Yes                      |
