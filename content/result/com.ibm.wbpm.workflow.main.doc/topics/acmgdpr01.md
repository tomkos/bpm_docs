# Developing GDPR-ready solutions and cases

- Make the property value editable in Case Client by
exposing it in the appropriate views or by using the default system generated view. If the value
cannot be edited in Case Client, personal data must be
removed directly from the target object store by using IBMÂ® Administration Console for
Content Platform Engine to navigate to the
Properties tab for the case folder.
- If the property is required, provide a default value that can be used to replace any personal
data.
- If you use case operations with properties, ensure that you do not hard code any personal
data.
