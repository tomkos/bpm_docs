# Library mirroring

When you bring a process application or toolkit into your
workspace, the libraries associated with them have library mirroring
enabled. You cannot change the setting.

When you associate a
library in your workspace with a process application or toolkit that
you have brought into your workspace, library mirroring is not enabled
by default. You can enable library mirroring if you want to share
the artifacts in your library in Integration Designer with Process Designer.

To
see if a library has mirroring enabled and, if permitted, change the
setting, right-click the library and from the menu select Properties > Business Integration > Library Mirroring. A check box
beside Mirror the library as soon as it is associated with
the Process Center determines if mirroring is enabled.

There
may be circumstances when you may not want users in Process Designer changing
artifacts. For example, you may have business objects for a standard
financial report used in your corporation that must be left as is.
Consider setting up users and groups and restricting access to only
those who are authorized to make updates to the artifacts.
