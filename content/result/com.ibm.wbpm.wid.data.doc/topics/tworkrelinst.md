# Adding, editing and removing instance data

## About this task

The Instance Data page has two sections. On the left side
there is a tree containing all instance data objects and their role
instances. On the right side there is the user defined properties
table, where you can enter values for the user defined properties
for each instance data or role instance. If a role instance is selected
in the tree on the left side, the key attributes table shows the key
attribute names for which you can enter values. If a relationship
instance is selected in the tree on the left side, the key attributes
table is intentionally empty.  The instance data represents the instance
of the relationship. The role instance represents the instance of
a role.

Instance data can be added by
using the Add button. To remove a specific
instance data, select the instance data to be removed and use the Remove button.
The instance data ID can be modified by entering a new value for it.
There are only integer values allowed to be used for the instance
data ID. For the property value table, apply the same rules as for
the user defined properties table of the relationship or role.

Each
role instance must have the key attribute values set. This can be
done by working on the key attribute value table. Here you can enter
values for a specific key attribute, which should be used in the static
mapping.
