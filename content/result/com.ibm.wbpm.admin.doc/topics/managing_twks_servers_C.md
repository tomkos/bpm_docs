You must have administrative access to the Workflow Center repository to add, edit, or remove offline
servers. For more information, see Granting access to the Workflow Center repository.

## Procedure

To add offline servers to Workflow Center:

2. Click Add a New Offline Server.
3. In the Create New Server window, give the server a unique name, choose
the environment type, provide a description (optional), and then click

appropriate type. For more information, see Restricting installation access to runtime servers.
