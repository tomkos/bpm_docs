# Keyboard shortcuts for the integration debugger

Many of these keyboard shortcuts can be invoked from the  
menus, which you can open by pressing Shift+F10.

In
the Debug perspective, keyboard shortcuts are available in the following views
and windows:

- Debug view
- Breakpoints view
- Breakpoint Properties window
- Variables view
- Component editors

The shortcut keys for each of these views are described in the following
sections.

## Debug view

The following table describes the integration
debugger shortcut keys that you can invoke in the Debug view:

| Key combination   |  Function                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| (Shift+F10)+M     | Resume the component thread execution      |
| (Shift+F10)+S     | Suspend the component thread execution     |
| (Shift+F10)+T     | Terminate the component instance execution |
| (Shift+F10)+I     | Step into the element or executing code    |
| (Shift+F10)+O     | Step over the element or executing code    |
| (Shift+F10)+U     | Step out of the element or executing code  |

## Component editors

The following table describes
the integration debugger shortcut keys that you can invoke in the component
