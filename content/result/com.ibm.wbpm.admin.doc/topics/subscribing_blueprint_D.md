# Removing Blueworks Live
subscriptions

## Procedure

To remove existing subscriptions to Blueworks Live processes, complete the following
steps:

1. In the library, expand the Processes category in the designer, right-click the subscription
that you want to remove, and select Delete.
2. When prompted, confirm that you want to remove the subscription.
Select the check box if you want to remove artifacts that were imported into the process
application when you subscribed to the Blueworks Live
process. If the check box is cleared, the artifacts will remain in your process application, but
they will no longer be linked to the subscription. Important: If you select the check
box, you might remove artifacts that are still in use by other processes. Artifacts such as teams or
service flows can be shared among processes.

## Results

The subscription and, if selected, the imported artifacts are deleted. When you delete a
subscription, historical snapshots retain their subscription details and library items.
