# Supported web service standards

For some support (for example,
the Web Services Notification (WS-Notification) specification), the
specific capability is listed as Not supported because
it is not present in the  IBM Business Automation
Workflow supplied
programming model. However, for IBM Business Automation
Workflow Advanced,
the capability is present and available to be used in the underlying
application server (WebSphereÂ® Application
Server 8.5) with
its supplied programming model and tools accessible by way of Integration Designer perspectives.
These entries are marked in the following tables with an asterisk
(*).

For a complete list of web services supported in WebSphere Application
Server 8.5, see  Specifications and API documentation.

## Web services

The web services
standards are listed in Table 1:

The standard is supported through the supplied WebSphere Application Server programming model.                                                                   |

Policy
set support: Beginning in Version 8.5, policy sets could be added
to a web services server configuration or an outbound or inbound web
service integration. Policy sets include policy types to create a
complete set of policies (or properties) that are available to be
configured within that policy set. Policy types are a set of related
policies (or properties) that are supported by a particular Quality
of Service (QoS). Examples of policy types included in these standards
are WS-Security and WS-Addressing. An example of a policy set is the
Username WSSecurity default policy set which is one of the default
policy sets shipped with WebSphere Application Server. Policy sets
are not included in these standards.

## Web service security

The
web service security standards are listed in Table 2:

| OASIS Web Services Security: SAML Token Profile 1.1 Note: This specification is supported only in reference to the SAML Version 1.1 and 2.0 assertions within SOAP messages. SAML tokens can be used for inbound web services and outbound web services. However, you cannot reliably propagate the same inbound token to outbound web services as there are scenarios where the token is lost due to thread boundary changes, such as when a business process definition is invoked from the inbound service. For outbound web services you will need to create or request a token from a Security Token Service (STS.
