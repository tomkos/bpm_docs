# Disabling prompts for generated event definitions in the event
definition editor

When you open an event definition that was generated using
the event definition generator rather than created using the event
definition editor, you receive a prompt that warns you that any changes
that you make to the event definition in the event definition editor
will be overwritten the next time you use the event definition generator
to regenerate the event definition. However, you can set a preference
to disable the prompt.
