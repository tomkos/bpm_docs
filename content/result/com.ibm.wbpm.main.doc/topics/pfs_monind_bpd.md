# MBeans for BPD indexers

## MBean objectName

Every JMX MBean associated with a BPD
indexer has an Object Name with a name. The syntax for the Object Name is
com.ibm.bpm.federation.server:type=Indexers,subtype=BpdIndexers,name=indexerUniqueID.

indexerUniqueID
is a string based on the ID of the BPD indexers and of the federated system they refer to in the
Process Federation Server
server.xml file, and has the following format:
federatedSystemID.indexerID.
federatedSystemID is the value of the id attribute of the ibmPfs\_federatedSystem element, and indexerID is the value of the id attribute of the ibmPfs\_bpdIndexer element.

If
no id attribute is specified for the BPD indexer, then Liberty assigns a default
value with the format default-n, where n is a
positive integer that starts at 0. In that case, the indexerUniqueID string
corresponds to the federatedSystemID.default-n.

```
<ibmPfs\_federatedSystem  id="bpm1" .../>
<ibmPfs\_bpdIndexer federatedSystemRef="bpm1" .../>
```

```
<ibmPfs\_federatedSystem  id="bpm1" .../>
<ibmPfs\_bpdIndexer id=idx1 federatedSystemRef="bpm1" .../>
<ibmPfs\_bpdIndexer id=idx2 federatedSystemRef="bpm1" .../>
```

| runUnscheduledChangeLogCompaction | Runs the Change Log Compaction operation immediately, unless the scheduled mode for this operation was not disabled.Note: When the compaction runs as a non-scheduled operation, the compactionProcessingThreshold that is used internally to defer compaction is ignored. | None     | status=acknowledged, processBatchSize=<maintenanceProcessingBatchSize>, processCount=<number of rows deleted>, allDatabaseEntryProcessed=<Boolean> The processBatchSize property is determined by the value of the maintenanceProcessingBatchSize property. processCount is determined by the number of rows deleted in the Compaction operation. The compaction is run in batches sizes determined by the value of the compactionProcessingBatchSize property. allDatabaseEntryProcessed is determined by comparing the number of rows deleted by the unscheduled compaction job with the value of the maintenanceProcessingBatchSize property. If the number of rows deleted by the unscheduled compaction job (processCount) is larger than the value of maintenanceProcessingBatchSize (processBatchSize), then the allDatabaseEntriesProcessed return value will return false. Therefore, you must ensure that the value of the compactionProcessingBatchSize property is greater than the value of the maintenanceProcessingBatchSize property.   status=failed,reason=scheduledOperationEnabled if the scheduled maintenance operation is not disabled. |
