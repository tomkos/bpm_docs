<h1>Gateway Endpoint Lookup mediation primitive</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>You can use the Gateway Endpoint
Lookup mediation primitive to create various types of service gateway.</p>

<p>You
can create a proxy gateway that routes requests to virtual services
defined in proxy groups. A proxy gateway is a specific
type of service gateway that defines proxy groups with which the administrator
can associate real endpoints. Alternatively, you can create other
types of services gateways that route to web service endpoints, based
on the action specified in the message.</p>

<p>If you create a proxy
gateway, the service definitions are stored in a built-in configuration
store. If you create another type of service gateway, the service
definitions are stored in WebSphere® Service
Registry and Repository (WSRR).</p>

<p>The Gateway Endpoint Lookup
mediation primitive has one input terminal (in),
two output terminals (out and nomatch)
and a fail terminal (fail). The in terminal
is wired to accept a message and the other terminals are wired to
propagate a message. If a suitable endpoint is found, the out terminal
propagates a message that includes the endpoint. If an endpoint is
not found, the nomatch terminal is fired. You
can wire the nomatch terminal to another mediation
primitive that decides where to forward the message to. If an exception
occurs during the routing resolution, the fail terminal
propagates the input message, together with any exception information
contained in the failInfo element.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<ul>
<li>The dynamic callout address, in the SMO header, is set with the
first match: /headers/SMOHeader/Target/address</li>
<li>The alternate targets list, in the SMO header, is updated with
the remaining matches: /headers/SMOHeader/AlternateTarget</li>
<li>All services found are also placed in the primitive context: /context/primitiveContext/EndpointLookupContext</li>
</ul>

<p>The
Gateway Endpoint Lookup mediation primitive uses the Endpoint Reference
structure defined by the WS-Addressing specification. For more information,
see: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing.</p>

<h2>URL and XPath Modes: Proxy gateways, proxy groups,</h2>

<p>and virtual services</p>

<p>In IBM® Integration
Designer,
you can use the Patterns Explorer view of the Business Integration
perspective to create a proxy gateway. Use the menu options: Window &gt; Show View &gt; Patterns
Explorer  &gt; Proxy Gateway.
The Patterns Explorer creates a mediation flow that includes the Gateway
Endpoint Lookup mediation primitive.</p>

<p>To create a proxy gateway
you must define one or more proxy groups, using the Gateway Endpoint
Lookup mediation primitive. When you install the proxy gateway module
to IBM Business Automation
Workflow,
the proxy groups are created in a built-in configuration store.</p>

<p>Using
the Gateway Endpoint Lookup mediation primitive, you must also specify
a point in the request message where the name of a virtual service
can be found. A virtual service is a proxy for one or more real services.
You specify whether the virtual service name is found using the inbound
URL, which is the default, or an XPath. After you have installed the
proxy gateway module, you can use a Business Space widget to define
the virtual services in the proxy groups. Using the Proxy Gateway
widget, you create associations between the virtual services and the
real service endpoints; the associations are stored in the built-in
configuration store.</p>

<p>Before a client can access a proxy gateway,
it needs the WSDL to call a virtual service. You can retrieve the
WSDL by entering the endpoint of the virtual service URL in a web
browser, and appending the string: ?wsdl. For example, http://zzz/Gold?wsdl,
where http://zzz/ is the address of the proxy gateway
and Gold is the name of the virtual service.</p>

request</p>

<ul>
<li>Proxy Group Name: One or more proxy groups
that are created in the built-in configuration store, when the module
is installed. IBM Business Automation
Workflow has a
built-in configuration store.</li>
<li>Lookup Method: whether the virtual service
name is the same as the input URL, or found
using an XPath expression.</li>
<li>Lookup XPath: If
you specify a Lookup Method of XPath,
you must specify where the virtual service name can be found in the
SMO.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Action Mode: Service gateways and action-based routing</h2>

<p>In
order for a service gateway to use action-based routing, a web service
request must contain an action either in the SOAPAction field or the
WS-Addressing Action field. If a web service request contains both
action fields, the values of the fields must be the same.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lookup Method: set the Lookup
Method to Action.</li>
<li>Registry Name: Either the name of a particular
instance of WSRR, or IBM Business Automation
Workflow, or the
default instance.</li>
<li>User Properties</li>
<li>Classification</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Service gateways act as proxies to
services and allow you to access multiple services from one address.
In addition, service gateways can encapsulate transformations, routing,
and common processing. Both the Gateway Endpoint Lookup primitive
and the Endpoint Lookup primitive can be used to create service gateways.</p>

<p>If
you want to route requests based on the action specified by a message,
use the Gateway Endpoint Lookup primitive to create a service gateway
with a lookup method of action.</p>

<ul>
<li>Gateway Endpoint Lookup mediation primitive properties</li>
</ul>

<p>You can specify values for mediation primitive properties either by using the property fields in the IBM Integration Designer user interface or by using an XML format. The property field names displayed in IBM Integration Designer are generally different from the property names used when building a mediation flow using XML code. In the following information, icons are used to identify each property name used in IBM Integration Designer and the corresponding XML name. (Where applicable, XML names that are required, but not shown in IBM Integration Designer, are also described.)</p>
