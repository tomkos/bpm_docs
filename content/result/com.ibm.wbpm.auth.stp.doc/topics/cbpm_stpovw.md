      practices, see Chapter 3: Development best practices in IBM Business Process Manager V8.5 Performance Tuning and Best
        Practices.

- Getting started with IBM Integration Designer

IBM Integration Designer solves the key problem today of integrating data and applications to create technical solutions for complex business processes. To understand how to use Integration Designer, you must understand the product's architecture and features.
- Authoring scenarios

Use scenarios to understand and work with components and products from the business process management family.
- Integration Designer samples

Samples demonstrate the use of IBM Integration Designer in several common situations.
- Working in teams

For teams to work effectively, the environment should be set up appropriately and team
members should understand the characteristics of the software configuration management (SCM) and
versioning systems that they are applying.
- Services and service-related functions

Services provide functions for a business process, which itself is a sequence of services. Creating services separately from a business process means a service can be developed independently of a business process and that many types of business processes can reuse that service.
- Developing BPEL processes with Integration Designer

The business process editor is based on Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) and provides a visual representation of your business process. Use Integration Designer to develop BPEL processes for deployment to IBM Business Automation Workflow.
- Defining and transforming data

You can learn how to define business objects to contain application data, and how to
create maps to transform data from one format into another so that data can be exchanged between
different services. You can also learn how to import existing schemas.
- Advanced development topics

You can use the information in this topic to perform advanced development to your process such as: adding Java code; using visual snippets, setting qualifiers; and generating documentation on your resources.
- Testing modules

In IBM Integration Designer, you can test your modules in two ways. In unit testing, you
choose components and interfaces, and then you test the operations one at a time in the integration
test client. In component testing, you use the new test suite editor to create test suites and test
cases.
- Managing builds

In IBM Integration Designer, you can use the Build Activities view to select specific
build activities that you want to occur during automatic or manual builds. You can also use the
Build Activities view to invoke immediate manual builds that temporarily override your selected
build activities.
- Editing module deployment properties

In IBM Integration Designer, any changes that you directly make to module deployment
properties in deployment descriptor files are typically overwritten when the deploy code is next
regenerated. However, you can use the module deployment editor to specify and retain changes to
module deployment properties, such as changes to the web services security settings.
- Working with servers

In IBM Integration Designer, you can work with both unit test environment (UTE) servers
and process application servers. A set of server tools is provided that enables you to accomplish
multiple tasks, such as creating servers, deploying applications, and starting or stopping
servers.
- Troubleshooting and problem determination

IBM Integration Designer provides numerous tools to help you troubleshoot problems in
your applications, such as the integration debugger and a Server Logs view that enables you to work
with cross-component tracing and server consoles and logs.
