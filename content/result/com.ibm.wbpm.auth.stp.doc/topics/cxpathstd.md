# XPath overview

- In mediation flows, the message logger's root property takes an
XPath expression that specifies which part of the message is available
to the mediation primitive for processing.
- In mediation flows, you can use XPath to identify one or more
fields in a message and use these fields to filter or select by specifying
a value.
- In BPEL processes, you can use XPath to reference parts of a BPEL
variable as from-statement or as to-statement in an assign activity.
- In BPEL processes, you can use XPath to specify conditions, such
as exit conditions and loop conditions.

You can use the XPath Expression Builder to visually build your
XPath expression. The XPath Expression Builder provides a navigation
tree of the message from which you can select parts for your XPath
expression.
