<h1>Solution pages for roles</h1>

<p>The solution pages are displayed when a user first opens the solution in Case Client. These pages remain open
during the user's session.</p>

<p>You can create custom solution pages to meet the needs of a specific role. You then associate the
custom pages with that role. See Promoting case solutions to workflow projects.</p>
