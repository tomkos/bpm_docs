# Adding additional event definitions to an event definition
file

By default, the event definition editor enables you to
create one event definition for each event definition file. Although
it is generally considered a best practice to have only one event
definition for each file, you can nonetheless set a preference that
will enable you to add additional event definitions to a file in the
event definition editor.
