<h1>Documents view for the Case Information</h1>

<p>widget</p>

<p>The Documents view includes a toolbar that contains by default
an Add button, a Open button, and an
Actions button. The view also provides a pop-up menu that can be used to
perform actions on selected documents or folders.</p>

<p>Typically, searches are not case-sensitive. An exception is object store searches,
which are case-sensitive by default. You can change this default search behavior and enable
case-insensitive searches for object stores. For more information, see Setting case-insensitive search behavior for object store searches.</p>

<p>You can move documents in a case folder. To move documents, use the Move to
Folder action in case folder documents view in case information widget. However, you
cannot move external repository documents or external reference documents in case folders.</p>
