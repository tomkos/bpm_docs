The token is returned as a string in the csrf\_token property of the response
object. Every call to Workflow  REST API operations must include a valid token in the HTTP header
BPMCSRFToken.

Any attempt to call a Workflow REST API with an expired token fails with HTTP response code 403
and error\_number CWTBG0651E in the response, which indicates that the token could
not be verified and that the token must be renewed. To retrieve a new token, the client application
must call the /bpm/system/login API again. The client application can then use the
new token to resubmit the failed request.
