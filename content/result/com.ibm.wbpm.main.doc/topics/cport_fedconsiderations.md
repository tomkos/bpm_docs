# Federation considerations for Process Portal

Differences in behavior can be observed when Process Portal runs in federated environments instead of on
a single system.

## Entries in the Dashboards and Launch
list

| One entry for each exposed dashboard, custom dashboard, launchable process, and launchable service. | The Work and other saved search dashboards are federated, which means you see only one entry for each dashboard in the list. However, the ready-to-use dashboards (Processes, Team Performance, Process Performance) are not federated, which means you see one dashboard entry in the list for each federated system. The federation behavior of custom dashboards and launchable processes and services is configurable. You can configure these entities so that they have only one entry in the Dashboards list or an entry for each federated system. For more information, see Federation considerations for dashboards, processes, and services in Process Portal. |

- Federation considerations for dashboards, processes, and services in Process Portal

In federated environments, you can configure how many times a launchable entity, such as a dashboard, in a process application that is installed on different federated systems is shown in the navigation in Process Portal. Federation policies determine how multiple occurrences of the same entity are handled.
- Actions available in Process Portal in federated environments

Process Portal can be configured for a single system or for a federated environment. The actions that you can take in Process Portal depend on the configuration.
- Federated systems and authorization for saved searches

Authorization for creating, updating, and deleting shared saved searches is determined by the corresponding security roles for the com.ibm.bpm.federated.rest.authorization REST service. These roles are set in the <authorization-roles> section of the Liberty server.xml configuration file.
