# Quick tasks

Quick tasks are displayed in the To-Do List widget. A case worker can create a quick task by just
typing in the name. After the task is created, the case worker can add a description, assign the
task, and set the due date. A quick task is marked closed by a single click in the To-Do List
widget.
