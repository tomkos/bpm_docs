# Adding security to Business Process Choreographer web services
applications

## About this task

- HTTP transport layer
- JMS transport layer

You can replace the Business Process Choreographer
web service security policy by an alternative authentication mechanism.
However, it is not possible to invoke Business Process Choreographer
web service operations as an unauthenticated user, so one authentication
mechanism is always required.
