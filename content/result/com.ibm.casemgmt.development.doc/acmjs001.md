# Developing case management applications with  JavaScript API

The JavaScript API provides classes that represent
case management objects, such as solutions, case types, cases, and activities, as well as classes
that represent components of the client user interface, such as page widgets, dialog boxes,
toolbars, and pop-up menus. The JavaScript API  uses the
Dojo toolkit, which is an open source JavaScript library
for web development.

In addition to the IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow
JavaScript API, you use the IBM Content
Navigator
JavaScript API to customize your client application. The
IBM Content
Navigator
JavaScript API includes more modeling classes and widget
classes that you can use in your application.

The TWProcessInstanceParentCase JavaScript API provides methods that processes
that run under a case activity use to interact with their parent case. For more information, see
TWProcessInstanceParentCase.

- Workflow JavaScript packages

This topic provides a sample script that shows how scripts can be used to add new values to a business object. If a script is added to the Add Case page in Page Designer, the business object is populated with values from the script when the case is added.
