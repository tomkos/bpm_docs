# Viewing and managing Performance Data Warehouse queues

The Performance Admin Console provides access to both the Load
Queue and the Error Queue as described in the following sections.

- Viewing performance records waiting to be loaded

 Traditional: 
The Performance Data Warehouse Load Queue holds database records that are waiting to be loaded or pruned. The View Load Queue page in the Performance Admin Console can be used to view the pending records in this queue. You can also see whether an error is preventing the records from being loaded or pruned. If no records are pending, the Load Queue is empty.
- Viewing and managing error records

 Traditional: 
The Performance Data Warehouse Error Queue lists all database records that failed to load because of an error. The Error Queue is similar to the Load Queue, except that it shows only those records that failed to load. Plus, the View Error Queue page enables you to remove selected records or you can attempt to reprocess them.
