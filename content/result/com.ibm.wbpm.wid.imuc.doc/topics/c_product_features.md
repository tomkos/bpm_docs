# Available features

When you install the IBM Integration
Designer product by using the
launchpad, you can select which features within the product to install according to your
requirements. A default set of features is selected for you (including any required features). The
launchpad automatically enforces any dependencies between features and prevents you from clearing
any required features.

Adapters can be individually selected. Install only the adapters that you require.
