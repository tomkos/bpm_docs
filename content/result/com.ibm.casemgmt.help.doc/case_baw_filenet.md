# Using 
FileNet
 processes to implement
activities

- Automating case activities with FileNet P8 processes

You can use IBM FileNet Process Designer and Case Builder to integrate new or existing FileNet P8 processes into a case solution.
- Enhancing case solutions that use FileNet processes

You can enhance your solution by using IBM FileNet Process Designer to add primary queues, add more in-baskets, and define custom roles.
- Adding rule operations to an activity by using IBM FileNet Process Designer

You can use rule operations to run business rules in a workflow. For example, you can use rule operations to determine process routing or update case properties.
- Configuring the in-basket property synchronization settings

When a property value is updated in a case, the change is synchronized in all views of the case. You might experience performance issues if all property updates are set to synchronize automatically. To improve performance, you can disable the automatic synchronization for certain properties.
