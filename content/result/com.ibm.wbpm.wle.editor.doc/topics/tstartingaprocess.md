# Starting a process

When you create a process, a Start event is automatically included.
Depending on how you want to start the process you choose the implementation
type of the start event. See Event types

- Document start event

A document start event simplifies the starting of a process that uses information from an ECM system.
- Starting a process by using a REST API call

External services, such as an IBMÂ® App Connect event-driven flow, can interact with a process by using a REST API call.
