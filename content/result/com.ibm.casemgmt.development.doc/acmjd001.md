- Configuring your environment to use Java API

To develop case management applications with the workflow Java API, you must configure your system to use both the workflow Java API and the Content Platform Engine Java API.
- Configuring your environment to use the Content Platform Engine Java API

To develop case management applications with the workflow Java API, you must configure your system to use the Content Platform Engine Java API.
- Java API Components

The Java API is organized into a set of major components that you use to build an application.
- Example: Java API Context

With the correct context, a UserContext can be established in the calling thread before calling IBMÂ® Case Manager Java API methods or directly calling Content Platform Engine Java API methods.
