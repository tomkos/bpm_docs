| When you use the launchpad to install IBM Integration Designer and three install files are not unpacked into the same folder, you might see the following message: Unable to get property 'availableSize' of undefined or null reference.                                                                                                                 | Extract the files into the same folder.  From a command line, use either unzip or 7z and type 7z x IID\_V21*.zip -y -o \IBM\temp\IID or  mkdir \IBM\temp\IID   unzip IID\_V21* -d \IBM\temp\IID  The directory should list the following contents: autorun.bat autorun.inf disk1 disk2 disk3 launchpad launchpad64.exe launchpad64.ini WTE\_DISK  When the installation is complete, delete the \IBM\temp\IID directory. |
| You receive the SQL1092N message when trying to install Integration Designer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | You received this message because you don't have user permission and, therefore, the launchpad couldn't create the Unit Test Environment. To work around this issue, see How to recover from Launchpad SQL1092N error when creating a Unit Test Environment.                                                                                                                                                          |
| When you use IBM Installation Manager and add the repository from disk1, you see the following warning: Installation Manager cannot find the files for the following disks: 2,3 in IBMÂ® Integration Designer 21.0.3. If you continue by clicking Yes, you proceed to a screen that displays Checking prerequisites, but the progress bar stays at 0%.     | Extract the files into the same folder:  From a command line, use either unzip or 7z and type 7z x IID\_V21*.zip -y -o \IBM\temp\IID or  mkdir \IBM\temp\IID   unzip IID\_V21* -d \IBM\temp\IID  The directory should list the following contents: autorun.bat autorun.inf disk1 disk2 disk3 launchpad launchpad64.exe launchpad64.ini WTE\_DISK  When the installation is complete, delete the \IBM\temp\IID directory. |
| Exceptions thrown during installation of Integration Designer. The Installation Manager log files contain the following error:java.io.Exception: CreateProcess:   "C:\...\security.update.bat" error = 5The error indicates file-access permission problems. This problem can be caused by anti-virus software interfering with the installation process. | Ensure that you have sufficient permissions to install on this system and disable anti-virus software while you install Integration Designer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| The test server does not appear in the Servers view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Verify the profile was created. The default profile directory is C:\IBM\IID\WORKFLOW\profiles. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where IBM Integration Designer is installed. Enter the following command: wid.exe -clean. If the server still does not appear, create a new server following the instructions in Creating test environment servers.                                                |
