# Task flows

A task flow puts together all the different tasks that are required
to achieve a goal such as creating a service, starting with setup,
or planning and ending with testing. Task flows are presented as a
series of grouped tasks, and each task is a link. When you click a
link, wizards and editors are launched along with an information window,
so that you are learning in the context of the task that you are doing.

To launch the task flow catalog, click Windows > Show
View > Task Flows.
