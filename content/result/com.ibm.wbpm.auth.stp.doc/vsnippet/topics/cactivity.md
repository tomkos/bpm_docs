# Custom behavior

The IBM Integration
Designer family have been designed so that users can compose integrative business solutions with minimal programming skills. One example of this is the visual snippet editor that you can use to graphically compose customized behavior as snippets of Javaâ„¢ code.

## An example of customized behavior

Perhaps
you are composing a process in the process editor, and you need to
modify your data in a way that the available activities do not provide.
In such a case, you could use the visual snippet editor to create
some customized behavior to make the process do exactly what you want
it to do.

## Business roles and customizing activities

the library to avoid the replication of work.

In this example, the first user has extensive technical
skills and a sound knowledge and background in the business in question.
This user determines what customized activities are likely to be needed,
creates them, and stores them in a library. The second user is able
to easily access and use these custom activities without having to
know why and how they were created. Using this system, there is no
reproducing the same work.
