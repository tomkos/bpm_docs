# Sticky notes

A sticky note is a function that you access from any artifact.
Sticky notes are used as reminders. Sticky notes can be used for project-related
work or non-project related work.

For example, a sticky note can be created to a human task reminding
the developer to email a document to a manager. The document can be
part of the human task, or remind a developer to email their status
report.
