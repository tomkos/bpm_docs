# Deploying an application that has an adapter binding

## About this task

Follow these steps for generic application deployment when the applications use adapter bindings.
Each adapter in an Advanced
deployment environment also has specific information
about deployment.

- Planning to deploy your applications, which include making several important decisions about
your deployment. These decisions affect the work that you do during deployment and after during
maintenance.
- Deploying your applications. You can deploy your applications in several ways. However, the way
you deploy your applications depends on the choices you made during the planning stage.

- Planning to deploy your applications that have adapters

You must make several decisions about your deployment before you deploy an application that uses an adapter. Each type of deployment option has advantages and disadvantages.
- Deploying your application with an embedded adapter

You can deploy your application with the adapter that you bound to your application when you developed it.
- Deploying your application with a stand-alone adapter

To deploy your application without the adapter, install the adapter files separately as a stand-alone adapter on each application server where you deploy your application. Then, complete additional steps so your deployed application refers to the adapter.
