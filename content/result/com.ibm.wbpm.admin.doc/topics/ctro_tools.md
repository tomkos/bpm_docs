# Tools for troubleshooting your applications

During development of your applications, you can use debugging
tools in Integration Designer.
You can implement runtime troubleshooting capabilities into your applications
using logging and tracing. Administrators of running applications can use the
failed event manager to view, modify, resubmit, and delete failed
operations between Service Component Architecture (SCA) components.

- Debugging applications in IBM Integration Designer

To debug applications that are running on IBM Business Automation Workflow, use your application development tool, such as IBM Integration Designer.
- Using logging and tracing in your applications

Designers and developers of applications that run on IBM Business Automation Workflow can use capabilities such as logging and tracing that add troubleshooting features to applications.
- Tracing problems related to persistence

When you encounter problems related to persisting data at run time, traces can be useful in analyzing the source of the problem.
- Using the IBM Business Automation Workflow data collector

Use the IBM Business Automation Workflow data collector, which is installed with IBM Business Automation Workflow, to gather some of the standard information that is needed to debug IBM Business Automation Workflow issues. This command-line tool can gather log file or configuration information.
- Troubleshooting Service Component Architecture processing and call chains

Cross-Component Trace identifies whether a Service Component Architecture (SCA) operation completed successfully. It allows you to identify systemout.log or trace.log data that is associated with modules and components. The log records hold information about errors or events that occurred during processing and can be used for problem determination using IBM Integration Designer.
- Working with failed events in IBM Business Automation Workflow

 If an event fails, it is stored in a database in the failed events manager. Use the failed event manager to search for and handle failed events.
