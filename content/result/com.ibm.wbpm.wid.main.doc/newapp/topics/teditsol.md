# Editing integration solutions in the integration solution editor

When you create an integration solution, an integration
solution diagram is also automatically created. You can open the integration
solution diagram in the integration solution editor and perform numerous
tasks, such as displaying transaction paths between components or
launching project or resource editors to view or edit projects and
resources.

## About this task

- Displaying or hiding module components, imports, and exports

By default, module components, imports, and exports are not displayed in integration solution diagrams in the integration solution editor. However, you can expand the modules to display the components, imports, and exports or contract the modules to hide them.
- Opening project and resource editors

In the integration solution editor, you can open project and resource editors to view or edit the projects and resources that comprise your integration solution. For example, you can open the assembly editor, dependency editor, interface map editor, and various other resource editors.
- Displaying transaction paths in integration solutions

In the integration solution editor, you can display and highlight the transaction path between components in a single module or between the components in all of the modules that comprise your integration solution. You can also display and highlight the transaction path from a specific component to the other components with which it interacts. If you choose, you can remove the highlighting from the transaction path.
- Hiding or displaying names and types of imports, exports, and components

In the integration solution editor, you can choose to hide or display the names and types of imports, exports, or components of an expanded module when you hover your cursor over them.
- Coloring modules

In the integration solution editor, you can color modules or change the color of modules that are already colored. This enables you to more easily distinguish one module from another or perhaps assign certain colors to groups of modules.
- Hiding or displaying libraries and other projects

If you are working with an integration solution diagram in the integration solution editor and your diagram is consists of many modules or mediation modules, you can improve the visibility of the diagram by hiding associated projects like libraries, Java projects, component test projects, and simple projects.
- Automatically adjusting the layout of integration solution diagrams

If you are working with an integration solution diagram in the integration solution editor and you find that the layout of the diagram has become disorganized or difficult to view, you can instantly adjust the layout of the diagram.
- Hiding or displaying integration solution diagram overviews

An integration solution diagram overview is a small image of the entire integration solution that is displayed in the lower right corner of the integration solution editor. It enables you to see the structure and content of the integration solution without scrolling. You can hide or display the overview as necessary.
- Fitting integration solution diagrams into the integration solution editor

You can choose to automatically fit an entire integration solution diagram into the current size of the integration solution editor. When you maximize or minimize the window or drag the window to resize it, the integration solution diagram will be automatically resized to fit the window. However, if you use the zoom tools, the integration solution diagram will no longer be automatically fitted to the current size of the integration solution editor until you choose to automatically fit it again.
- Adding and connecting sticky notes in the integration solution editor

In the integration solution editor, you can add sticky notes for a variety of purposes, such as for task lists or reminders. You can also connect sticky notes to one or more modules in your integration solution diagram.
- Resizing integration solution diagrams in the integration solution editor

You can reduce or enlarge the size of integration solution diagrams using the zoom tools of the integration solution editor.
