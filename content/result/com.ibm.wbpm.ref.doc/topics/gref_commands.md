# Commands and scripts

These commands add to those provided for the underlying WebSphere® Application
Server and its service
integration technologies.

For information about WebSphere Application
Server administrative
commands, see the following WebSphere Application
Server topics: Command-line utilities and Commands (wsadmin scripting).

- Administrative console actions with command assistance

 Traditional: 
Command assistance is available for a subset of administrative console actions. When available, command assistance displays the wsadmin scripting command for the last console action that you performed. You can then use this data to create wsadmin scripts that automate certain administrative tasks.
- Profile commands in a multi-profile environment

When two or more profiles exist within one installation of IBM Business Automation Workflow, certain commands require that you specify the profile to which the command applies. Alternatively, you can use the versions of the commands that exist in the bin directory of the profile that you want to act on.
- Command-line utilities

 Traditional: 
Look up a command by its name to find detailed syntax and usage of the command.
- Commands (wsadmin scripting)

 Traditional: 
Look up a scripting object or command class to find details about its command syntax.
