# Limitations of business objects

- Due to a limitation in the Business Process Choreographer
tag library in IBMÂ® Integration
Designer,
JSPs generated as human task clients will not be able to accomodate
xsd:any, choice and substitution group constructs out of the box.
You will need to use your own custom code using the Service Data Object
(SDO) API in order to work with these constructs. For more information,
see IBM Technote 1306783.
- Some assistive screen readers may not be able to read the contents
of the table view properly. It is recommended that users of screen
readers who experience problems with this view work in the graph view
and properties view instead. However, there is no editing function
which can only be performed in the table view.
- The business object editor will work with a wide variety of well-formed
XSD beyond what is generated by the tool itself. This allows imported
XSDs to be viewed and edited in the tools alongside natively created
business objects. If an imported XSD contains attribute group or element
group references however, the business object editor may disable some
editing functionality related to attribute reordering. Also, renaming
and changing the type is also disabled. Essential editing capabilities
(cardinality, patterns, and so on) will continue to be enabled.
