|        | Activity           | Use this tool to add an activity to the service flow diagram. The following types of activities are available:  Service Task This task starts a service. The service can be an external service, that is, a service that calls an application outside of IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow. See Calling an external service.    Server Script Task A script uses JavaScript to access and manipulate data. If you need to generate large amounts of text, you can switch the script to a scriptlet in the Properties view. The script language is JavaScript, except that in scriptlets, the syntax is as described in Using scriptlets in script tasks. For more information about the JavaScript API, see JavaScript API. For information about adding global JavaScript functions as managed server files, see Managing external files.    Content Integration Task A content integration activity integrates with Enterprise Content Management (ECM) servers. See Building a service that integrates with an ECM system or a BPM store.     Decision Task Use the Business Action Language (BAL) Rule component to author business rules using natural language technology or use a decision table. See Adding a Decision task to a service flow.    Modify Task A modify task enables you to specify values for a number of runtime configuration properties of a task. You can customize task properties such as the due date and duration, priority, status, subject, and who can work on the task. See Modifying tasks.    Linked Service Flow Activity A linked service flow calls another service flow or a heritage service such as an Ajax, general system, integration, or advanced integration service. When the linked service flow activity is triggered at run time, the linked process is run. After the linked process is completed, the parent process resumes execution. See Creating a service flow. |
|        | Exclusive Gateway  | Use a gateway to determine a change in the path of the service flow. An exclusive gateway follows only one of several paths, depending on a condition; that is, it is mutually exclusive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|        | Intermediate Event | Use this tool to add an intermediate event to the service flow diagram. The following types of events are available:   Message (sending) An outgoing message event sends a message to an undercover agent (UCA) while the service flow is running. You can configure the message event so that the incoming message is received only by a process that is in the same process application snapshot as this event. If the service flow is in a toolkit, the snapshot of the root process application is used. Multiple message events are supported. See Sending messages to undercover agents.    Error An error intermediate event catches errors. When you attach the event to the boundary of an activity, the error boundary event catches errors that occur when the activity to which it is attached runs. The error boundary event catches all the runtime and business errors. Each error boundary event must have an outgoing link. When you use the event as a stand-alone error event, it catches all the errors that are not caught by boundary event handlers. See Catching errors by using error boundary events.    Tracking A tracking event indicates a point in the service flow at which you want to capture the runtime data for reporting purposes. See Enabling runtime data tracking .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|        | End Event          | Use an end event to end the service flow. The following end event types are available:  None Ends the activities on a particular path.    Error An error end event throws an error and ends the processing of the service flow. To throw a specific error, in the Implementation properties of the error end event, set the error properties by specifying the error code and mapping the error end event to a specified variable. See Throwing errors in service flows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
