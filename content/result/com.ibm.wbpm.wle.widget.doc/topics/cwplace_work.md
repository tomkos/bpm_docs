# Completing work in Workplace

## Working with tasks

- Use the quick search  to trigger a full-text search of your task list. 
For more information, see Basic searches in Workplace.
- Use basic searches to customize your list view  by scoping your search and building and
combining filters to refine the results. Name and save your customized view for reuse or share it
with other people or your team. To share a saved view with another team, duplicate, rename, and
share it. For more information, see Basic searches in Workplace.
- Use advanced searches to obtain refined results that cannot be achieved through basic searches.
Advanced searches enable you to combine filters, use keywords such as NOT,
AND, and OR together, and consolidate multiple smaller queries
into one query to reduce maintenance and improve performance. For more information, see Advanced searches in Workplace.
- Expand rows to preview task data before opening the tasks and carry out actions from the
overflow menu . Batch
modify  the properties
of multiple tasks that you select directly from the task list.
- Set up email notification to be informed when a new task is assigned to you or your team. Before
you can enable the notification function, your administrator must configure the email environment to
send Workplace
notifications.
- Access custom dashboards that provide information tailored to specific business needs. For quick
navigation, copy  and
share or bookmark the URL of your Workplace pages.
- Benefit from the automatic refresh of your task list whenever task changes occur. When the
notification server is not available to trigger the auto refresh, the refresh button  becomes available for you to
refresh your task list manually.
- Improve your efficiency by using the AI-infused task prioritizationfeature, which sorts your current list and prioritizes the best high-value tasks for you tocomplete.Youradministrator can set the task prioritization to be
    - Enabled by default: Your list is automatically prioritized. Any subsequent
re-sorting of the list overrides the prioritized sorting.
    - Enabled manually: You have the ability to toggle the task prioritization on or off.
By default, prioritization is turned of. When you turn it on, the prioritized sorting overrides the
current sorting of the list.

## Working with workflows and cases

You can view your lists of workflows and cases and start them to complete different types of work
from the start page. You can also quickly access your recent work through the
Recent and Favorites lists. Similar to the task list, you
can search, sort, and filter your workflow and case lists.   For ease of use,
Workplace provides
separate lists of workflows and cases that you can participate in. Working with case instances in Workplace on-premises is
available only in federated environments. See Configuring Workplace for a federated environment.

- Start workflows to complete structured, sequential collaborative work. You can start your own
workflow from a predefined activity or launch an existing workflow and use configured tasks and
activities to complete the work. When you start the workflow, a task for the first activity is
generated and is added to the task list of the assignee who does the work. When the first task is
complete, the next task is kicked off. Work continues automatically from one task to the next, and
documents and activities are completed until all the work is complete.
- Start cases to complete unstructured collaborative work. In a case, you can start activities as
needed, by using a non-sequential work pattern. The case can contain required activities that can be
started automatically, and optional activities that can be started manually. When an activity is
started, its tasks are completed by the assigned users or teams.
