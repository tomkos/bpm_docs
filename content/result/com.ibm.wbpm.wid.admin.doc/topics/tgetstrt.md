# Getting started with the integration test client

## Before you begin

## About this task

To illustrate how to work with the integration test client,
an example module named OrderEntry is used. The OrderEntry module
is a basic order processing application that has three components:
ProcessOrder, CheckData, and CheckAvailability. The ProcessOrder component
accepts your order and calls the CheckData component to determine
whether the specified purchase order is valid. If the purchase order
is valid, the CheckAvailability component creates the order and automatically
adjusts the current availability of any ordered items.

To run
a test with the default test configuration:

## Procedure

1. Open your module in the assembly editor. The example
module OrderEntry is shown in the following figure of the assembly
editor:
2. If you decide to make any changes to the module in the
assembly editor, ensure that you press Ctrl-S to
save your changes.
3 In the assembly editor canvas, complete one of the followingsteps: For the purposes of this topic, we will assume that you haveused the Ctrl key to select the ProcessOrder and CheckDatacomponents and that you selected Test Components in Isolation . Theintegration test client opens and displays an Invoke eventin the Events area, as shown in the figure below: An Invoke event is automaticallygenerated whenever you start the integration test client. It is aninteractive event, which means that you must manually select an operationand specify values for the operation before the test can continue,as described in the following steps.
    - If you want to test your entire module, right-click an empty
portion of the canvas and select Test Module.
(By default, any unimplemented components and unwired references in
the module will be emulated.)
    - If you want to test a subset of components in your module,
use the Ctrl key to select the components in the set, then
right-click one of the selected components and select Test
Components in Isolation. (By default, any unselected components
in the module will be emulated regardless of whether they are implemented
or not.)
    - If you want to test a single component in your module, right-click
the component and select Test Component or Test
Component in Isolation. (By default, if you select Test
Component in Isolation, all other components in the module
will be emulated regardless of whether they are implemented or not.)

4 In the Detailed Properties areaof the integration test client, complete the following steps: The figure shows the detailed properties that are selected inpreparation for invoking the takeOrder operation, which is containedin the OrderProcessingInterface interface of the ProcessOrder component.

1. In the Configuration field, ensure
that the correct test configuration is selected. A default test configuration
is automatically created whenever you open the integration test client.
If you did not open the integration test client by loading a test
configuration that you saved earlier, the default test configuration
will already be selected in the Configuration field.
2. In the Module field, ensure that
the correct module is selected. If you opened the integration test
client by selecting a module, this module will already be selected
in the Module field.
3. In the Component field, ensure
that the component is selected that contains your interface operation.
4. In the Interface field, ensure
that the interface is selected that contains your operation.
5. In the Operation field, ensure
that the operation is selected that you want to test.
5. In the value editor, specify values for the selected operation
by clicking your cursor in the Value column
for each attribute in the editor, then typing in a value in the text
field and pressing Enter. For example, the
figure below shows that the value clothes has
been specified for the description attribute:
If you want to specify values for arrays, right-click the name
of each array attribute in the Name column
and select Add Elements to open the Add Element
dialog box, then specify a value for the selected attribute in the Enter
the number of new elements to add field and click OK. For
example, the figure below shows that the value 5 has
been specified for the quantity attribute within
the array element in the items array attribute:
6. Click the Continue icon.
Depending on the current deployment state of your module, the Deployment
Location wizard opens, as shown in the figure below: In the Deployment
Location wizard, IBM Workflow
Server appears
as a selectable deployment location. If your module contains only Javaâ„¢ components or it contains Java
2 Platform Enterprise Edition components that are all unimplemented, Eclipse
JVM will appear as a selectable deployment location. If you are testing a module that is deployed as part
of a process application or a toolkit, IBM Workflow
Center Server appears
as a selectable deployment location.Note: If you have more than
one module in your test configuration, the Deployment Location wizard
will be preceded by a different deployment wizard that asks you to
select a specific server for each module.
7 Complete one of the following steps:

- If your module contains at least one component that is not
a Java component or if you want
to test a set of interacting modules, ensure that IBM Workflow
Server is
selected in the Deployment location list box.
(This is the designated server for running SCA applications, BPEL
business processes, human tasks, transition tables, business rules,
selectors, and other resources. You can also use this server for running
mediation flows contained in mediation modules.)
- If your module is deployed as part of a process
application or a toolkit, ensure that IBM Workflow
Center Server is
selected as the deployment location. If there are multiple modules
in the process application or toolkit, all the modules are tested.
- If your module is a mediation module, ensure that IBM Workflow
Server is
selected as the deployment location.
- If your module only contains Java components
and you don't want to test a set of interacting modules, or if your
module contains Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition resources but none
of the components are implemented, you can select Eclipse
JVM. (The main advantage to choosing the Eclipse JVM is
that it starts more quickly than IBM Workflow
Server.
However, once started, both runtimes provide similar test performance.)
8. In the Mode drop-down list, select
either Run or Debug to
start the server in Run or Debug mode. (If the server is already running
in one of these modes, the Mode drop-down list
will show the current server mode and it will be disabled.)
9. Click Finish. If server security
is enabled for your selected server, a User Login window opens. Type
your administrative user ID and password and click OK.
(The default user ID and password is admin.)
The server is started (if it is not already running) and the module
is deployed to the server, which enables the invocation of your operation
to continue. In the integration test client, the Events area rapidly
displays several events that together form a test trace of your test.
If a manual emulator is encountered, the test pauses at a manual Emulate
event. If no manual emulator is encountered, the test will complete
and pause at a Return event. When a test is run on the takeOrder operation
of the example module OrderEntry, the test pauses at a manual Emulate
event (because the CheckData component has no implementation and is
being emulated).
10 Before you specify values for your manual Emulate event,complete the following steps to familiarize yourself with the detailedproperties for each event that was generated before the manual Emulateevent. The actual events generated before the manual Invoke eventwill vary depending on the operation that you chose to test.

1. In the Events area, select the Invoke event
under the Invoke started event. In the Detailed
Properties area, you can view the properties and the input parameter
values that were passed to your operation. For example, the input
parameter values that were passed to the takeOrder operation are shown
in the following figure:
2. In the Events area, select the monitor Request event
(if any exists). In the Detailed Properties area, you can view the
request that was monitored as it flowed over the wire between components.
For example, the request that flowed over the wire from the ProcessOrder
component to the CheckData component is shown in the following figure:
11 In the Events area, select the manual Emulate eventwhere the test is currently paused, as seen in the following figure: A manual emulation event is automatically generated in the followingsituations: Much like a manual Invoke event, a manual Emulate event is aninteractive event that requires you to take some action before thetest can continue. However, unlike a manual Invoke event, a manualemulation event requires you to either specify output parameter valuesor select an exception to throw.Note: The flow of control throughan emulated component or reference may be contained in a transactionwith a specific timeout value. If you do not specify the value inthe allotted time, the transaction may time out and cause the invocationto fail with a timeout exception.

- You have chosen to test an entire module and the integration test
client has encountered an unimplemented component.
- You have chosen to test a set of components or a single component
in a module, which means that any other unselected components in the
module are automatically emulated regardless of whether they are implemented
or not.
12 Complete one of the following steps:

1. If
you want to pass output parameter values rather than throw an exception,
specify the output values in the Value column
of the Output value editor. For example, the
figure below shows the output value of 6:
2. If you want to throw an exception, select the exception
that you want to throw from the Throw exception drop-down
list, then specify some values in the Output value
editor. The Throw exception list box is shown
in the figure below: Note that the only exceptions that can be thrown
are those that are specified as faults in the interface or in the throws clause
of a Java interface.
13. Click Continue to continue the invocation
of the operation. If you chose to pass some output parameter values
rather than to throw an exception, the Events area displays a Return event
and the test completes. In the Detailed Properties area, the results
of the operation are displayed. For example, in the following figure,
the value editor shows the results that were returned for the takeOrder
operation:
A Return event is automatically generated when the integration
test client returns the results of the operation. A Return event is
an informational event, which means that there is no action for you
to take other than to view the results that were returned.
14. To familiarize yourself with the detailed properties for
a monitor Response event, select the monitor Response event
(if any exists). In the Detailed Properties area, you can view the
response that was monitored as it flowed over the wire between components.
For example, the response that flowed over the wire from the CheckAvailability
component to the ProcessOrder component is shown in the following
figure:
15 Complete one of the following steps:

1. If you want to rerun the operation and either specify
new output parameter values or select an exception to throw for the
manual Emulate event, right-click the top-level Invoke event
in the Events area and select Rerun.
2. If you want to rerun the operation using the same output
parameter values or exception that you used earlier for the manual
emulator, right-click the top-level Invoke event
in the Events area and select Rerun with Auto Emulate.
3. If you want to select a different operation for testing,
generate a manual Invoke event in the Events area by clicking the Invoke icon.
Then select an operation, specify some input parameter values, and
invoke the operation as described at the beginning of this topic.
16. Press Ctrl-S at any time to save
the current test trace to a test trace file. Information about working
with a test trace is found in the topic "Managing test traces."
