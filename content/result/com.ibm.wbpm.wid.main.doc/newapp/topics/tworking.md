# Working with integration solutions in the Business Integration
view

In the Business Integration view, there are a number of
tools that you can use to more easily manage your integration solutions.
For example, if you have a lot of integration solutions, you can choose
to focus one and hide the rest.

## About this task

- Hiding or displaying sections for integration solutions and projects

By default, the Business Integration view is divided into two sections - the Integration Solutions section and the Projects section. These two sections help keep integration solutions separate from the projects that they referenced. However, you can choose to either hide or display the two sections. If you choose to hide the two sections, all of the integration solutions and referenced projects will be displayed together in the Business Integration view.
- Hiding or displaying the solution focus drop-down menu

In the Business Integration view, you can choose to hide or display the solution focus drop-down menu. This menu enables you to choose between displaying only a single integration solution and its referenced projects in the Business Integration view or displaying all integration solutions and their referenced projects in the Business Integration view.
- Focusing integration solutions in the Business Integration view

In the Business Integration view, you can choose to focus a single integration solution and its referenced projects or to display all integration solutions and their referenced projects. When an integration solution is focused in the Business Integration view, all other integration solutions and their referenced projects are hidden.
- Locating the project associated with a project reference

In the Business Integration view, you can easily locate the project that is associated with a specific project reference in an integration solution. This is especially useful if you have a lot of projects.
- Checking referenced shared projects out of team repositories

In the Business Integration view, you can check out shared projects from a team repository that are referenced by an integration solution:
