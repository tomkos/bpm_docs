# Interfaces

In the diagram that follows, interfaces, indicated by an I, link
the components in a module. The inputs and outputs of each component,
specified by the interface, determine which data can be passed from
one component to another. An interface is created independent of the
implementation of the component. An interface may also be created
for a component that has no implementation; that is, the implementation
will be done later.
