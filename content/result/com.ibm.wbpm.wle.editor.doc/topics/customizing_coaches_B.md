# Adding custom images to a heritage coach (deprecated)

When you need to add custom images, add the necessary files to your process application as
managed assets. See Managing external files for more information. When you add an
image as a managed file, you can simply drag the image from the library in the Designer to the
design area of an open heritage coach. Using this method, your images are included when you install
snapshots of process applications on servers in test, production, or other environments.

To add custom images to non-heritage coaches, see the related information.
