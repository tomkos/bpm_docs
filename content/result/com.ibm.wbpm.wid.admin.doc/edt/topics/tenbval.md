# Enabling or disabling incremental validation in the event definition
editor

In the event definition editor, incremental validation
is disabled by default. This means that validation rules are not enforced
(and validation errors are not displayed) as you work with an event
definition in the event definition editor. However, when you attempt
to save the event definition, validation rules will be enforced regardless
of whether incremental validation is disabled. A preference is provided
that enables you to choose whether you want incremental validation
enabled or disabled by default.
