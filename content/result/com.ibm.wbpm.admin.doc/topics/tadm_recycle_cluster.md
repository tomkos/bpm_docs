# Stopping and restarting a cluster member

## Before you begin

1 Prevent new work from entering the cluster member:
    - If you are using the IBMÂ® HTTP
Server, change the plugin\_cfg.xml file to remove
the cluster member for HTTP traffic. If you are using another HTTP
server, follow the directions for your HTTP server to remove the cluster
member.
    - For IIOP traffic, set the runtime weight to zero for the cluster
member.
2. Verify that work that is destined for the cluster member is complete.
Either wait a period of time or use Performance Monitoring Infrastructure
counters to determine when the cluster completes all of the queued
work.
