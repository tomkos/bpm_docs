## Before you begin

## About this task

Business Process Choreographer Explorer.

## Procedure

1. In the Views tab,
navigate to the Activity page for the activity and click Restart.
For example, on the Process Instances Administered
By Me page, click the name of a process instance. On the Process
Instance page, click the Activities tab,
and click the name of the activity you want to restart.

an error occurs when the activity restarts.
3. If an expiration time is set for the activity, specify
the expiration behavior for the restarted activity.
