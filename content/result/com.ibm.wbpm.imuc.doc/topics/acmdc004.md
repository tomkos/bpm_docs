# Setting permissions for a case type class

## About this task

The default setting for CREATE\_INSTANCE allows any user
who can log in to create a case. If you want to allow only certain
users to create cases, this default setting is not appropriate. You
can change the permissions on the case type class.

The default
setting of  #CREATOR-OWNER allows the creator of a case to retain
full control over the case and remain the owner of record. If you
do not want the creator of a case to retain full control over the
case, then the default value for owner is not appropriate. You can
change the setting to make the owner value blank, or you can assign
ownership to a group.
