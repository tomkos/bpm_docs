# Human task clients

- IBM® Forms interface
- HTML-Dojo page
- Business Process Choreographer client
- WebSphere® Portal portlet
- JavaServer Faces (JSF) client

Clients can be defined for both inline and stand-alone human tasks.
You can create one client for all the human tasks in a module, or
you can create a separate client for each task. You can even provide
multiple clients for the same task, if you want users in different
roles to see different options for the task.
