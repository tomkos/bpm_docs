<h1>Planning for shared or dedicated desktops</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>If you have a limited number of target environments in production, you can use the
default IBM Case Manager desktop to provide access to solutions through Case Manager Client. As your
production environment grows, you might want to group and separate target environments that share a
user base or some other distinguishing characteristic.</p>

<p>For example, you might separate target
environments that are accessed by different groups of users. You might also want to group target
environments based on organizational divisions or geographical locations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Faster solution discovery</li>
<li>More relevant and specific security settings</li>
<li>Application customization and themes for the user or organizational unit</li>
</ul>

<p>When you create solutions and target environments, consider whether it can benefit your
production environment to group them by using a custom dedicated desktop.</p>
