# Managing changes for Blueworks Live processes

## Before you begin

- To update existing subscriptions to Blueworks Live processes,
you need a Blueworks Live account.
See http://www.blueworkslive.com.
- If you are not using the default Blueworks Live server,
before you can update subscriptions to Blueworks Live processes,
the administrator must import the Blueworks Live signer
certificates into the IBM Business Automation Workflow server
truststore. See Adding a signer certificate to the default signers
keystore and IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) cannot connect
to Blueworks Live due
to a missing or expired certificate.

## Procedure

1. Open the designer.
2. In the library, expand the Processes category in the designer, and open the
subscription.
3. Check for any changes by clicking Check for
New Version.  You are notified if there have been any updates to the Blueworks Live process. Note: A Blueworks Live process only shows up as
updated if a new version (snapshot) of the updated process has been created.
4. To keep the processes in sync, manually update your process
or BPD and the related artifacts to match the updated Blueworks Live process.
5. Click Reset Subscription Date to
set the last subscription date to today.

## What to do next

Create a  version (snapshot)of the changes so that you have a record of the updates.
