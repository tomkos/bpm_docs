# Business process administration tools

- Command-line tools are simple programs that you run from an operating system command-line prompt
to perform specific tasks. Using these tools, you can start and stop application servers, check
server status, add or remove nodes, and other tasks.
- The WebSphere administrative (wsadmin) scripting program is a non-graphical command interpreter
environment that enables you to run administrative options in a scripting language (Jython or Jacl)
and to submit scripting language programs for execution. It supports the same tasks as the
administrative console, as well as many of Workflow Center tasks. The wsadmin tool is intended
for production environments and unattended operations.
- Administrative programming interfaces are a set of Java classes and methods under the Java
Management Extensions (JMX) specification that provide support for administering Service Component
Architecture (SCA) and business objects. Each programming interface includes a description of its
purpose, an example that demonstrates how to use the interface or class, and references to the
individual method descriptions.

Access Workflow Center
through a web browser (for example, http://host:9080/ProcessCenter).

The Process Admin Console includes the Process Inspector,
a tool to view and manage process instances for process applications
that are running on a specific process server.

Access the Process
Admin Console through a web browser (for example, http://host:9080/ProcessAdmin).

Access
the Business Performance Admin Console through a web browser (for
example, http://host:9080/PerformanceAdmin).

If
you have installed a stand-alone profile, you have a single node in
its own administrative domain, known as a cell. Use the administrative
console to manage applications, buses, servers, and resources within
that administrative domain.  Similarly, if you have installed and
configured a network deployment cell, you have a deployment manager
node and one or more managed nodes in the same cell. Use the administrative
console to manage applications, set up managed nodes in the cell,
and monitor and control those nodes and their resources.

Access
this console through a web browser (for example, http://host:9060/ibm/console or https://host:9043/ibm/console).

You can access the
IBM Administration Console for
