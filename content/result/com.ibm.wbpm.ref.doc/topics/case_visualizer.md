# Case Visualizer

You can configure the Case Visualizer by using the configuration properties. When Case Visualizer
view is used in the context of the process user task page, the view configures itself based on the
parent case, without specifying the Case identifier and Target Object Store name in the viewâ€™s
configuration.
