# Fields in the Settings pane of the Properties View Designer lose focus in Internet Explorer

This problem, which occurs only if you are using Case Builder in
Internet Explorer, forces you to place the cursor in the field after you type each character.

To work around this issue, type the value in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, cut and paste
the value into the Name, Collection ID, or
Property ID field in the Settings pane of the
Properties View Designer.
