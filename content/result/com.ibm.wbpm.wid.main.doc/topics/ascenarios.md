- Scenario: Developing a new process with an Advanced Integration service

This task is likely to be done by a business analyst or a developer with good knowledge of the business.

- Scenario: Developing a straight through process

In this scenario, a BPEL process exists and has been deployed. A business analyst or developer uses IBMÂ® Process Designer to define a process requiring manual steps and a screen flow.

To make the BPEL process available for adaptation in Process Designer, the process needs to be associated with a process application and published in the Workflow Center.
