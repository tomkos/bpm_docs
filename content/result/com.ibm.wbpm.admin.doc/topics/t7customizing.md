Explorer is based on the Business Process Choreographer Explorer,

For Business Process Choreographer Explorer this is the My To-dos view, and for Business Process Archive Explorer it is the Process Instances Administered By Me view. If you have one of the system administrator roles, you can change the views that are shown to your users in the navigation pane, and the default view that they see when they log in.
