# Filtering in the Business Integration perspective

You can use filtering to reduce files you do not need in
the Business Integration view or the Physical Resources view.

## About this task

By default, you can use filtering for both data and interfaces
in the Business Integration view and XSD files in the Physical Resources
view. You can filter many other types of artifacts in a Preferences
page. To set these preferences, click Window > Preferences > Business Integration > In-place Quick Filtering.

To
exclude unwanted files from the view with filtering, complete the
following steps:

## Procedure

1. Click a category or object in the view. A
filtering option shows. If there are no contents under the category,
the filter is disabled.
2. Click again to display the filter field.
3. Type a letter or number of letters. The
contents of the category excludes all items that do not match the
filter string.
4. Click (show all) to show the whole
list again.
