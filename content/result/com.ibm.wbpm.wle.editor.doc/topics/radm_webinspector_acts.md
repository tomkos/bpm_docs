# Run actions in the Inspector

The actions that are available in the Inspector depend
on the element that you selected and its run time state. When you
select a process instance, you see the actions that you can perform
on that instance. Similarly, if you select an activity or a task,
the actions that you can perform on that activity or task are available.

| Terminate               | Terminate the execution of failed or suspended process.Before you terminate a process instance, check if the instance has dependent relationships. If the instance depends on other instances, terminating the instance also terminates the instances that it depends on. You can wait for all of the instances to complete before you terminate the dependent instance. Or, if you want to keep these dependency instances, you can remove the relationship before you terminate the instance. If you still want the relationship to be visible, you can add an independent relationship before you remove the dependent relationship. To terminate instances in a dependent relationship, you must have the authorization to terminate all the dependent instances. For example, instance A depends on instance B and instance B depends on instance C. Terminating instance A terminates instance B and instance C. Terminating instance B terminates instance C. If you have the authorization to terminate instance A and instance B but not instance C, you must either remove the relationship between instance B and C or get a user with the appropriate access to terminate instance C, before you can terminate instance A. After a process instance is terminated, you can only delete the process instance. There is no way to revive a terminated process instance. |

## Activity actions

Ad hoc (or unwired) activities
in a process are listed in the Activities section. The following table
lists the actions and describes the transition that happens for the
activity when you click the action. The list of actions that you see
depends on the state of the process instance.

| Action   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Disable  | Moves READY and WAITING activities to DISABLED state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Start    | Moves READY and WAITING activities to WORKING state. If the action is repeatable, the process instance gains an copy of this activity and the copy is optional. For WAITING activities, clicking Start overrides the wait condition on the activity.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Enable   | Moves the DISABLED activity according to whether it is automatic or manual and whether its preconditions are fulfilled or not: Automatic activities that do not have preconditions or that have fulfilled preconditions move to WORKING state Manual activities that do not have preconditions or that have fulfilled preconditions move to READY Activities that do not have fulfilled preconditions move to WAITING state. |

## Task actions

The following table lists the
actions that you can take on a task. The availability of some of the
actions depends on the status of the task and its parent instance.

| Action          | Description                                                                                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Run             | Runs the task                                                                                              |
| Debug           | Debugs the task                                                                                            |
| Return to team  | Removes the assignment to the user from the task and returns the task back to the team.                    |
| Edit data       | Expands the Data section so that you can review and edit the task data.                                    |
| Modify due date | Changes the due date to the day and time that you specify.                                                 |
| Modify priority | Changes the priority to the level that you specify.                                                        |
| Skip            | Skips the task to send the process instance to the next step in its flow. You cannot undo the skip action. |

## Timer actions

The only available action
is Fire now. This action overrides the timer
and sends the flow along the path that exits the timer. For example,
a review activity has an attached timer (a boundary event) that leads
to an escalation path.

## Message event actions

There no available
actions for message events. The presence of a message event indicates
that the instance is waiting for a message to arrive.

## Relationship actions

The following table
lists the actions that you can take on a process instance relationship.
To see these actions, click a relationship in the instance relationships
list.

| Action           | Description                                                                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Edit description | Opens a window from where you can edit the description of the relationship.                    |
| Remove           | Removes the relationship between the two instances. The instances themselves are not affected. |
