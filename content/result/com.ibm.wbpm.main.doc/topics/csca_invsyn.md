# Synchronous invocation

When a service component is invoked synchronously, both the client (consumer) and the service
provider execute in the same thread. The calling component within IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow is blocked until a response is received from
the provider. Synchronous invocation can be selected on both request-response and one way
operations.
