# Viewing Rational documentation
in the help system

from the Internet. You can view this help from within the IBM® Integration

## Before you begin

## About this task

Sometimes you might want to use Rational tools for advanced
programming tasks. Some of these tools are available for use with IBM Integration
Designer.
To support those tools, a set of Rational documentation
is available with the Integration Designer help topics.

Contents pane, you can display it by using the Scope function above
the Contents pane.

system, click Scope to open the Select Scope
wizard.
2. Select Search only the following topics and
click New.
3. Select Rational Application Developer or a subset of that
help.
4. In the field at the top of the wizard page, give your new
list a name, such as RAD help.
5. Click OK and OK.
You should now see the Rational documentation in your
Help contents pane.
