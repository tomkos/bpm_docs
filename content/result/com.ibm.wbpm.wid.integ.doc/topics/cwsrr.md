# WebSphere Service
Registry and Repository (WSRR)

You can use WSRR to store information about services in your systems,
or in other systems, that you already use, that you plan to use, or
that you want to be aware of. For example, an application can check
with WSRR just before it invokes a service to locate the most appropriate
service that satisfies its functional and performance needs. This
capability helps make your deployment more dynamic and more adaptable
to changing business conditions.

You can access WSRR through the Endpoint Lookup primitive within mediation flows. You can configure WSRR from the administrative console of the IBMÂ® Workflow
Server or the WebSphere Enterprise
Service Bus. For information on WSRR, see the WSRR documentation at http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/sr/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.sr.doc/cwsr\_overview\_overview.html..
