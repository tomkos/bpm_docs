# Workflow Server and
runtime environments

In your authoring environments, the integrated  workflow server within Workflow Center enables you to run processes as you build
them. When you are ready, you can install and run those same processes on the workflow servers in
your runtime environments. The Business Performance Data Warehouse component collects and aggregates
process data from processes running on the servers. You can use this data to improve
your business processes.

The Process Admin Console enables you to manage the workflow servers in your runtime environments
(development, test, staging, and production) as well as the workflow server that is part of the
Workflow Center.
