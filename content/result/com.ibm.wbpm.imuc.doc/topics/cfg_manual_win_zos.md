# Configuring the profiles and network deployment environment using multiple tools
(deprecated)

- Creating or augmenting network deployment profiles

You must create or augment a deployment manager profile and one or more custom profiles before creating the deployment environment. Using profiles, you can have more than one runtime environment on a system, without having to install multiple copies of IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow.
- Configuring a network deployment environment using the Deployment Environment wizard (deprecated)

After performing a Custom installation and creating the deployment manager and custom (managed node) profiles, you can create a network deployment configuration based on the topology pattern templates packaged with the software.
- Creating and configuring DB2 for z/OS databases after network deployment profile creation

After creating or augmenting profiles, you or your database administrator must create the databases and their tables manually, and you must also run the bootstrapProcessServerData command before you try to start or use the IBM Business Automation Workflow server.
