# Import tab: BPEL process editor

The fields on this page list the business objects and
interfaces that are imported by this process. If the process uses
a business object or an interface, it must store a reference to that
file and as a result, an import statement is used.

If
there are imports that are no longer being used, you can press CTRL+ALT+O
(Organize Imports) to remove them. If an import is unused, or cannot
be detected, you may remove an import manually by clicking Delete.
