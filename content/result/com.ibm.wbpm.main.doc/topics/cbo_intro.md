# Business objects programming

- Programming model

To facilitate the creation and manipulation of business objects, the business object framework extends Service Data Objects specifications by providing a set of Java™ services.
- Programming using business object services

To facilitate the creation and manipulation of business objects, the business object framework extends SDO specifications by providing a set of Java services. These services are part of the package named com.ibm.websphere.bo.
- Programming techniques

These techniques illustrate how to effectively program business objects using the business object framework.
- Configuring logging properties for business objects

Use the administrative console to enable logging and to select the required log specification, level of detail, and output format of the log. Business objects provide different log specifications for different functionality areas, and selecting the appropriate level of logging helps isolate and troubleshoot the problems in that area.
- BusinessObject.properties file

The BusinessObject.properties file is used to configure the runtime behavior of the Business Object Framework.
