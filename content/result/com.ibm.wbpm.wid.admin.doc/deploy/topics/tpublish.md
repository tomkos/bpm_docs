# Publishing modules to test environment servers

## Before you begin

## About this task

When you have deployed a module that is part of a Process
Application and are testing the module on a Workflow Center Server,
the Publish action actually performs two separate operations. First,
the changed module components are delivered to the Workflow Center repository.
Then, the modules are deployed from the repository to the Process
Center Server.

To publish modules:

## Procedure

1. In the Business Integration or Debug perspective, click
the Servers tab to open the Servers view.
2. In the Servers view, right-click your running server and
select Publish. The modules are published to
the server.

## Results

If you are experiencing communication problems with the
remote server, such as problems in publishing to the remote server
or obtaining the status of the server, see the topic Resolving communication problems with remote servers.
