# System Data toolkit

The System Data toolkit (TWSYS) provides the base types and services that are required to
build a process, and is installed by default as a dependency with a process
application. Additionally, the toolkit has
integration services to integrate different technologies with a process. The technologies to
integrate with include email, JDBC, HTTP, XML, and datasources, such as databases, URLs, and email
servers.

## Services provided

- Database services – Use database services to upload or retrieve data from a database
provider.
- Integration services – Use integration services to integrate content from an HTTP provider or
the local file system.
- Mail services – Use mail services to send or receive email from a process.
- Quick Start services
- SLA services
- XML services

Traditional:  The System Data
toolkit provides various services that can be incorporated into a process or service flow. The
following services are not supported in the container version of Business Automation Workflow.

## User interfaces

- Fire Default BPD Event (Quick Start)
- Heritage Default Human Service (deprecated)
- Lsw Conditional Activity Selection Coach
- Lsw Save Conditional Activity Template Coach

The System Data toolkit also provides the implementation for the
Classic theme, which defines the look and feel of the coach.

- HttpClient – Uses the HTTP protocol to read and write data from an HTTP provider.
- HttpClient2 – Uses the HTTPS protocol to securely read and write data from an HTTPS
provider.
- Mail – Reads and writes mail using a MAP, POP, or SMTP protocol.
- SimpleXMLValidator – Validates XML documents.
- SOAPMessageConnector – Runs a web service.
- SQLConnector – Provides operations to run SQL statements on a database.

integration.jar file that contains the implementation of the external services.

    - BPD\_ID
    - BPD\_INSTANCE\_ID
    - LOCAL\_SNAPSHOT\_ID
    - SEQUENCE\_FLOW\_ID
    - SOURCE\_UUID
    - STEP\_NUMBER
    - TRACKING\_GROUP\_ID
    - TRACKING\_POINT\_ID
    - TASK\_ID, FUNCTIONAL\_TASK\_ID
    - TIME\_STAMP
    - SNAPSHOT
    - ACRONYM
    - TIME\_STAMP data
- SLASTATUS – Tracks the status of each SLA as a result of an SLA rollup.
- SLATHRESHOLDTRAVERSALS – Tracks a value whenever an activity with an
attached SLA completes.
