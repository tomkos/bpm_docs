# Case configuration tool

The IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow case
configuration tool is used to configure Case Builder, Case Client, and integration
points with other optional components. Based on the values that you
specify, the configuration tool configures the environment and deploys
the applications.

In a command-line environment, the Case configuration tool is
launched by running configmgr.exe in the directory workflow-home/CaseManagement/configure.
If the tool is run on Windows, it should be run with administrative
privileges.
