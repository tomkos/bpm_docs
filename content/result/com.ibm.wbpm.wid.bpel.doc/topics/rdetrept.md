# Repeat tab: BPEL process editor

## Timeout element

<!-- image -->

When you first
click the Repeat tab for the Timeout element (when used within an
event handler), you will see a properties page like the one shown.
The configuration options for the timeout element are similar to the
options on the Expiration tab: BPEL process editor. Keep in mind though
that you will be creating an expression that must evaluate to an integer,
otherwise a runtime exception will be thrown.
