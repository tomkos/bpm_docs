## About this task

To step out of component elements:

## Procedure

1. In the Debug view, ensure that the correct stack frame
is selected.
2. Click the Step Return icon . The component thread resumes and steps out of the element
that you had stepped into and it pauses at the next available component
element. For example, if you had stepped into a Java snippet
in a business process, the component thread steps out of the Java snippet and pauses at the next available
process activity.
