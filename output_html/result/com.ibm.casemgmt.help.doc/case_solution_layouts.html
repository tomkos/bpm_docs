<h1>Solution layouts</h1>

<ul>
<li>When you work with a new or promoted case solution in Workflow Center,
you can choose to either use new solution layouts that employ newer client-side human service
technology or keep the classic, widget-based solution pages. To take advantage of the new and
dynamic user interface capabilities in your case pages, use the new solution layouts.</li>
<li>When you work with a legacy case solution that was created in Case Builder and is not promoted to
Workflow Center, you can only access the classic widget-based solution pages. No solution
layouts are available in Case Builder.</li>
</ul>

<p>After you create a solution layout, you can assign it to a role. You can start with a default
Cases solution layout or, if you need solution layouts for specific role needs,
you can create custom solution layouts to use in place of the default layout. For more information
on how to create custom solution layouts and assign them to roles, see Creating custom solution layouts.</p>

</ul>

<p>IBMÂ® Business Automation Workflow includes a set of layouts that you can use in your solution. You can customize the layouts to meet the requirements of your solution. You can use the custom layouts as templates to create extra pages to provide customized views for different roles, case types, and activities.</p>
