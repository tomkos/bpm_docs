# Specifying the maximum depth of expanded business objects

## About this task

## Procedure

1. From the Window menu, select Preferences.
The Preferences window opens.
2. In the Preferences window, expand Business Integration and
select Test Suite Editor. The Test Suite Editor
page opens.
3. In the Maximum depth to automatically expand
business objects field, select a number for the maximum
depth to which you want to automatically expand your business objects
in the test data table. (Note that if you are working with large business
objects, specifying a very deep maximum depth could cause performance
problems. You should always specify a maximum depth that meets but
does not exceed your needs.)
4. Click OK. When you next open the
test suite editor, the nested business objects in the test data table
will be expanded to the depth that you have specified.
