# Reusing case data

## About this task

Sometimes, you want to reuse data from an existing case
in a new case. For example, a claim against a customer’s automobile
insurance might be filed as a single case. On further review, you
might decide that the claim includes property damage that needs to
be filed as a claim against the customer’s homeowner policy. When
you create the second case, you want to reuse data, such as customer
information and accident details, from the original case. In Case Client, reusing data in this
way is done by splitting the original case. When you split a case, Case Client populates any matching
property in the new case with values from the original case.

The
split case action is configurable, so you must contact your IBM® Business Automation
Workflow administrator to determine
whether the action is available and what it is called.

## Procedure

To create a case that reuses data from an existing case:

1. Open the case from which you want to reuse data.
2. On the Case Details page, click Split
Case or the equivalent action in your application and
select the type of case that you want to create.
3. On the Split Case page, modify and
add property values as needed.
4. Optional: 
Add documents from the original case
to the new case.
Adding documents to the new case does
not remove the documents from the original case.
5. Click Add.
It might take
a few seconds for the new case to be created.

## What to do next

On the Cases page, search for the
new case and then open it from the Case List widget. If you need the
ID of the new case, look in the history for the original case.
