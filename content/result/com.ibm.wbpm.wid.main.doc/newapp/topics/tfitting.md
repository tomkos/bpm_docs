# Fitting integration solution diagrams into the integration
solution editor

You can choose to automatically fit an entire integration
solution diagram into the current size of the integration solution
editor. When you maximize or minimize the window or drag the window
to resize it, the integration solution diagram will be automatically
resized to fit the window. However, if you use the zoom tools, the
integration solution diagram will no longer be automatically fitted
to the current size of the integration solution editor until you choose
to automatically fit it again.
