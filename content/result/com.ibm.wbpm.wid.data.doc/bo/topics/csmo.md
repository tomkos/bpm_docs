# Service message objects

Service message objects are used inside mediation flow components.
When a mediation flow component is invoked, the business object that
is input to the mediation flow is wrapped with additional context
and header information and becomes a service message object. This
contextual information, such as SOAP header information can be accessed
from within the mediation flow component.

object data, see the related links below:
