# Instructions for running the Hiring Sample process
application

The instructions for re-creating the sample for yourself are in the Hiring tutorial for Process Designer. See Hiring tutorial.

- Hiring Sample Overview

The Hiring Sample is included with Workflow Center. The sample introduces the features of Process Designer by showing you how to run a sample process.
- Managing access to the Hiring Sample process application (for administrators)

Administrators must provide access to the Hiring Sample process application so that users can view and run the process.
- Verifying access to the Hiring Sample process application

If the Hiring Sample process application is not already available in IBM Workflow Center, you must import it.
- Opening the Hiring Sample process application

Open the Hiring Sample process application to begin running the process in IBM Process Designer.
- Changing the Hiring Sample

Use the Hiring Sample process application to learn the product. Do not use it as a starting point for your own application because changing this process application might cause errors later.
- Playing back the Standard HR Open New Position process

Run the Standard HR Open New Position process in the Inspector view in IBM Process Designer to see the process run step by step.
