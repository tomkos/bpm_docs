# Environment tab: Human Task editor

Use the custom properties table to define properties for
BPEL human tasks. The table contains three columns:

- Provide a name for the custom property that you are adding.
- Provide a value of type string.
- Optional: Select a query table attribute if you are using one
of the predefined inline custom properties.

Click Add to create a new
property (in which case a new window opens that lets you enter the
key value pair), Remove to delete an existing
one, and Edit to make changes to one.
