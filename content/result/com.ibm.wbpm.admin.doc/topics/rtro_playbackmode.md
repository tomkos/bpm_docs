# Authors cannot drill down in a report

## Symptom and cause

```
You are not allowed to view this report.
```

As an author, you are granted temporary access to reports when you run them in playback mode in
Workflow Center, regardless of the permissions on
the report. However, you are not automatically granted permission to drill down in the report.

## Resolving the problem

In Workflow Center, grant yourself permission to
drill down in reports.
