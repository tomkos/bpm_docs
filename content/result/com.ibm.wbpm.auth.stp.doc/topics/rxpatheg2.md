# Example: Using conditions in XPath expressions

This example illustrates a simple order processing scenario.
Each order contains a field for the age of the order, along with customer
information. In this example, we want to identify orders that are
older than 14 days.

1. In the XPath Expression Builder, click Insert Simple
XPath.
2. In the Simple XPath Expression Builder,
navigate to the orderAge field.
3. Notice that the XPath expression is reflected in the Expression field:
4. Since orderAge is a not a repeating field, we will add a condition.
Expand Add an optional condition.
5. Click the Operator field, and click the
arrow to view the list of operators.
6. Select the greater than operator (>).
7. In the Value field, type 14.
8. Press Enter to complete the expression.
9. ClickOK to return to the main builder page.
Your completed XPath expression is shown.
10. Click OK.
