# Upgrading case types: Adding a case folder variable

## About this task

Shared variables help ensure the integrity of data
wherever it is used. You can pass the folder variable, rather than individual case properties, as
arguments to linked processes and services.

## Procedure

1. Convert the case type to a process.
2. Switch to the Variables tab.
3. In the Variables section, click Shared
Variables.
The Shared Variable Details section appears.
4. In the Shared Variable Details section, click
Create. 
A private shared variable is added to the process.
5. Optional: 
Update
the data mapping to pass the shared variable instead of individual properties. 
If you use the shared variable to pass data, you do not need to include the shared variable in
the output mapping.
6. Click Save or Finish Editing.
