<h1>Migrating and deploying case management solutions</h1>

<p>Add the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) technical user
(EmbeddedECMTechnicalUser) as a member of the Solution administrators user
group. The project and solution migration process configures this user as the owner of solution
artifacts. Solution administrators must be a member of the tw_admins group and have
access to the Workflow Server or
Workflow server repository.</p>

<p>For more information about EmbeddedECMTechnicalUser user, see Business Automation Workflow security roles.</p>

<p>For more information about the Solution administrators group, see Planning for security in the development environment .</p>

<li>Solution migration and deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>You can migrate a solution from one development environment to another development environment, a test environment, or a production environment. After you develop and test a case management solution, you must deploy the solution in the production environment to make the solution available for your case workers.
- Preparing for solution migration</p>

<p>To help you prepare for migration, identify and collect information about the solution assets that you want to migrate. In addition, prepare a comprehensive set of migration and deployment instructions that are tailored for your environment and solution applications. If your solution package includes assets that are managed by FileNetÂ® P8, you must create the FileNet Deployment Manager deployment tree and environment definition.
- Migrating solutions</p>

<p>To migrate a solution, you export the solution assets that were defined in Case Builder and optionally other solution application artifacts from the development environment.
- Deploying migrated solutions</p>

<p>Deploying a solution makes it available as an application in the target environment.
- Configuring the target environment after solution deployment</p>

<p>After you migrate a solution and deploy the solution package and its related assets, you must configure some system settings to make the solution operational.
- Modifying solutions after deployment</p>

<p>If you update the solution design, you can redeploy the solution to a production object store that already contains cases for the solution. Modifying a case and redeploying it affects existing case data and new case data. Before you modify a solution that was deployed into production, you must plan for how the changes affect both your new cases and existing cases.
- Verifying solution deployment</p>

<p>Verify your solution completely in your test and pre-production environments before you deploy the solution into production. After you deploy the solution, test the solution to verify that all of the components are working correctly.</p>
