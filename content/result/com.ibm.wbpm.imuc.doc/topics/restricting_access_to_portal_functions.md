## List of action policies

The
following table lists the action policies and the default security
group that is assigned to them. The BPMActionPolicy configuration
object is an array of pairs that match each action type with the roles
that can perform the action.

Attention: Shared saved searches from releases of Business Automation Workflow earlier than V19.0.0.3 do not have owners. Only users who belong to the security group assigned to the ACTION\_ADMINISTER\_SHARED\_SAVED\_SEARCHES action policy can update or delete these shared saved searches, by using the /rest/bpm/wle/v1/searches/tasks/saved\_search\_name REST API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | None; available to all users by default                                                                               |           |
| ACTION\_ADMINISTER\_SHARED\_SAVED\_SEARCHES | Create, update, and delete shared saved searches. These are saved searches that you shared with any team or everyone. Members of the assigned security group can also update and delete shared saved searches that are owned by other users, by using the appropriate saved search REST APIs. Members can also reassign ownership by using the /rest/bpm/wle/v1/searches/tasks/saved\_search\_name REST API. Attention:  By default, administrators can see only the saved searches that are shared with them. As an administrator, to access saved searches that are not shared with you, you must specify the identifier of the saved search in the REST call. Example: /rest/bpm/wle/v1/searches/tasks/{saved\_search\_id}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | tw\_admins                                                                                                             |           |
| ACTION\_MANAGE\_SAVED\_SEARCH              | Restrict the rights to create or edit personal saved searches to some groups of users.These user groups can see and run the saved searches that are shared with them. They can see, run, and delete their existing personal saved searches, and add them to, remove them from, their list of favorites (star), and they can edit or duplicate them. These user groups can also list, run, and duplicate shared saved searches, and manage their list of favorites, but they cannot edit or delete them. In the Work dashboard, the buttons for these actions are hidden to the users in groups who do not have creation and update rights. This action is used only to enforce the access to the saved search REST API. It is never explicitly returned by the /rest/bpm/wle/v1/searches/actions REST API.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Available to all users by default                                                                                     |           |
| ACTION\_RUN\_SAVED\_SEARCH                 | Restricts the users' rights to only execute saved searches. These user groups cannot create, delete, modify, or duplicate personal or shared saved searches. They can only run saved searches that have been shared with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | None.

| ACTION\_SAVED\_SEARCH\_SUPER\_ADMIN         | The most permissive saved search action policy. It allows users to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on any saved searches in the Business Automation Workflow system, including other users' private searches and shared saved searches. The super admin privileges are only available through direct calls to the saved search REST APIs. See REST interface for BPD-related resources. The default group for this action policy is tw\_saved\_search\_super\_admins, which has no members assigned to it by default. Users to whom you want to grant super admin saved search privileges must be part of the tw\_saved\_search\_super\_admins group.Tip: When you update saved search definitions that belong to other users, it is strongly recommended that you copy the exact saved search definition and make changes to it. Failing to do so might result in the system providing its own default values for any properties that were missing from the payload to the saved search REST API. | tw\_saved\_search\_super\_admins                                                                                          |           |
| ACTION\_VIEW\_USER\_PERSONAL\_DATA          | Authorizes non-administrators to call the IBM BPM operations REST API to get the personal data about an Business Automation Workflow user.

## Modifying the action policies contained
in the BPMActionPolicy configuration object

1. Start the wsadmin scripting
tool.deployment\_manager\_profile\bin>wsadmin -lang jython -conntype none
WASX7357I: By request, this scripting client is not connected to any server proc
ess. Certain configuration and application operations will be available in local
 mode.
WASX7031I: For help, enter: "print Help.help()"
2. Show
defaults.wsadmin>print AdminConfig.defaults('BPMPolicyAction')
Attribute                       Type                            Default
type                            String
roles                           String
3. Show the BPMActionPolicy configuration
ID.wsadmin>print AdminConfig.list('BPMPolicyAction')

    - To save your changes, you must run the AdminConfig.save() command each time
you modify a property, as in the following example. You can modify only one action policy at a
time.
    - In the following instruction, replace newrole with a role
such as tw\_admins or, to remove the role, replace
newrole with the empty string "". Remember to
run the save command
again.wsadmin>AdminConfig.modify(getBPMPolicyAction("ACTION\_ABORT\_INSTANCE"), [["roles", "newrole"]])
wsadmin>AdminConfig.save()

```
wsadmin>def getBPMPolicyAction(type):
wsadmin>  policyActions = AdminUtilities.convertToList(AdminConfig.list('BPMPolicyAction'))
wsadmin>  for policyAction in policyActions:
wsadmin>    if AdminConfig.showAttribute(policyAction, "type") == type:
wsadmin>      return policyAction
wsadmin>
wsadmin>AdminConfig.save()
wsadmin>print getBPMPolicyAction("ACTION\_ABORT\_INSTANCE")
(cells/N1Cell/clusters/cluster1|cluster-bpm.xml#BPMPolicyAction\_1363274323595)
wsadmin>print AdminConfig.showAttribute(getBPMPolicyAction("ACTION\_ABORT\_INSTANCE"), "roles")
tw\_admins
wsadmin>AdminConfig.modify(getBPMPolicyAction("ACTION\_ABORT\_INSTANCE"), [["roles", "newrole"]])
''
wsadmin>AdminConfig.save()
wsadmin>print AdminConfig.showAttribute(getBPMPolicyAction("ACTION\_ABORT\_INSTANCE"), "roles")
tw\_admins;newrole
wsadmin>AdminConfig.modify(getBPMPolicyAction("ACTION\_ABORT\_INSTANCE"), [["roles", []]])
''
wsadmin>AdminConfig.save()
wsadmin>print AdminConfig.showAttribute(getBPMPolicyAction("ACTION\_ABORT\_INSTANCE"), "roles")
[]
wsadmin>AdminConfig.modify(getBPMPolicyAction("ACTION\_ABORT\_INSTANCE"), [["roles", "tw\_admins"]])
''
wsadmin>AdminConfig.save()
wsadmin>print AdminConfig.showAttribute(getBPMPolicyAction("ACTION\_ABORT\_INSTANCE"), "roles")
tw\_admin
```

5. For the action policy changes to take effect, resynchronize the nodes and restart the BPM
server.
