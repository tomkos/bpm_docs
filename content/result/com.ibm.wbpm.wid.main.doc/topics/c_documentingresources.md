# Documenting resources

You can provide documentation within an artifact to describe
the artifact, add your comments and notes and include links to resources,
such as design documents. You can also generate reports for the artifacts
in your modules, mediation modules, and libraries describing the properties,
interfaces, business objects, references etc of the artifact. You
can customize the reports and generate detailed reports or summaries.

- Linking to external information in IBM Integration Designer

You can include a link to an external source by pasting the link into the Description field of a business object.
- Generated reports for artifacts

In addition to viewing resources, you might want to document the applications that you are building. IBMÂ® Integration Designer provides a tool to generate documentation for the artifacts in your modules, mediation modules, and libraries.
