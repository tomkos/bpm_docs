# Working with processes

Traditional:  The
IBM® Business Automation
Workflow plug-in for IBM Content
Navigator provides a
unified content workflow by bringing your Workplace task list into the IBM Business Automation
Workflow desktop.

You can then view your tasks in the desktop, claim them, and work on them just as you do in
Workplace. You can also start
a workflow process from a document in the IBM Business Automation
Workflow desktop.

## Before you begin

## About this task

If the Browse view is enabled for
the IBM Business Automation
Workflow desktop, the
Launch Process menu item is available to start processes from documents shown
in the Browse view. For more information, see Enabling the Browse view in the IBM Business Automation Workflow desktop.

If the document view
is enabled for the Case Information widget, the Launch Process menu item
might be available in Case Client
to start processes from documents shown in the Document view. This option requires that the
Launch Process item be added to the menu in Case Builder. For more information, see
Documents view for the Case Information widget.
