<h1>Search tips for documents</h1>

<ul>
<li>Click Add &gt; Add Document from Repository on the Documents tab in the Case Information widget.</li>
<li>Click Add in the Attachment widget and then select Add
Document from Repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can refine your search by using operators in the search term.</p>

<p>| Widget name and view                                                                                      | Version used                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Attachment widget, attachment name                                                                        | Current version document name          |
| Documents view for the Case Information widget, document name                                             | Major version (released) document name |
| Attachment widget, document propertiesDocuments view for the Case Information widget, document properties | Current version document properties    |
| Viewer widget                                                                                             | Current version document               |</p>

<p>In addition, an attachment can be defined to use a specific version of a document. The Attachment
widget will always display the specific version of the document and the properties for that version
even if more recent versions exist.</p>

<h2>Searching for exact words or phrases</h2>

<p>You can search for an exact phrase by enclosing
it in double quotation marks ("). For example, the search term "insurance
claim" searches for the two-word phrase insurance claim, not the separate
words insurance and claim. The search term insurance
claim, without the quotation marks, searches for the separate words
insurance and claim.</p>

<h2>Searching with wildcard characters</h2>

<h2>Searching with Boolean operators</h2>

<p>| Search term                             | Results                                                                                                                                                  |

| automobile AND "major loss"             | Narrows the search to include documents that must contain both the term automobile and the phrase major loss anywhere in the document.                   |
| automobile OR "major loss"              | Expands the search to include documents that contain either the term automobile or the phrase major loss anywhere in the document.                       |
| automobile -"major loss"                | Searches for documents that contain automobile and that do not contain the phrase major loss anywhere in the document.                                   |
| automobile OR truck -"major loss"       | Searches for documents that contain either the term automobile or the term truck and that do not contain the phrase major loss anywhere in the document. |
