# Maintaining and operating federated systems

The change log tables are maintained by a set of operations that process the transactions and cleanup the records.
- Modifying configuration properties

You can modify and adjust most of the settings of the ibmPfs\_federatedSystem element.
- Removing a federated system

You can remove a business process system from the federated system.
- Rebuilding an index

You can rebuild an index if problems occur with the Process Federation Server index.
- Disaster recovery

For your topology to support disaster recovery, there are several options which depend on how the federated data is indexed.

Reusable search queries managed with the /v2/search/queries REST APIs are stored into a dedicated index of the federated data repository.
