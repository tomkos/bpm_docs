# Search tips for cases

## Basic search

For the basic search, select the case property that you want to search on. For a simple property,
you then enter the value to be searched for.

For a structured property, which is a collection of properties, you can search for a single value
of a property within that collection. After you select the structured property, a second drop-down
list is displayed so that you can select the specific property within the collection. Then you enter
the specific value of that property that you want to search for.

## Advanced search

You can use the advance search to search based on complex criteria.

Depending on how your environment is configured, the search criteria might be case-sensitive.
