# Enabling multiple event definition capability in the event
definition editor

By default, the event definition editor enables you to
create or edit a single event definition for each event definition
file. Although it is generally considered a best practice to have
only one event definition for each file, you can nonetheless set a
preference that will enable you to add or edit multiple event definitions
in a single file from within the event definition editor. This might
be necessary if you are working with older event definition files
that contain multiple event definitions and you want to edit them
simultaneously in the event definition editor and perhaps add or remove
event definitions in the file.
