<ul>
<li>Opening a specific solution page</li>
<li>Opening a FileNet P8 process task page</li>
<li>Opening a workflow process task page</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opening a specific solution page</h2>

<p>You can create a URL that opens a specific solution page after you log in to Case Client.</p>

<h3>About this task</h3>

<p>The URL can open a solution page that was created in Case Builder in the Solution
Pages section of the Pages tab. The URL can open only a static
solution page that can be assigned to a role. The URL cannot open a dynamic solution page, such as a
page that was created in the Case Details Pages section of the
Pages tab.</p>

<p><code>
http://server\_name:port\_number/navigator/?desktop=baw&amp;feature=Cases&amp;tos=TOS03\_ccp00010&amp;solution=solution\_prefix&amp;page=page\_ID&amp;pageType=staticPage
</code></p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>To create a URL that opens a specific solution page:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the base URL of a solution by clicking the Test link in
Case Builder. To find the
Test link, hover the cursor over the solution on the Manage
Solutions page.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, the base URL of a solution with a prefix of ABC123 has the
following
format:http://MyServer:Port/navigator/?desktop=baw&amp;feature=Cases&amp;tos=TOS03_ccp00010&amp;solution=ABC123
2. Add the following page information to the base URL:
&amp;page=page_ID&amp;pageType=staticPage</p>

<p>To find the page ID, open the solution in Case Builder. The page ID is displayed in
the Unique Identifier box in the Solution Pages
section of the Pages tab.</p>

<p>For example, if you want a solution page with the MyWork page ID to open
when users log in to Case Client,
use the following URL:
http://MyServer:Port/navigator/?desktop=baw&amp;feature=Cases&amp;tos=TOS03_ccp00010&amp;solution=ABC123&amp;page=MyWork&amp;pageType=staticPage</p>

<h2>Opening a FileNet P8 process task page</h2>

<p>You can create a URL that opens a specific FileNet P8 process task page after you log in
to Case Client.</p>

<h3>About this task</h3>

<p>The URL can open a FileNet P8 task details page that was created in Case Builder in the Task Details
Pages section of Pages tab.</p>

<p><code>
http://server\_name:port\_number/navigator/?desktop=baw&amp;feature=Cases&amp;tos=TOS03\_ccp00010&amp;solution=solution\_prefix&amp;queueName=queue\_Name&amp;wobNum=wob\_Num
</code></p>

<h2>Opening a workflow process task page</h2>

<p>You can create a URL that opens a details adapter page for a workflow process task after
you log in to Case Client.</p>

<h3>About this task</h3>

<p>The URL can open a specific details adapter page that was created in Case Builder in the Task Details
Pages section of Pages tab and configured for an activity with a
workflow process.</p>

<p><code>
http://server\_name:port\_number/navigator/?desktop=baw&amp;feature=Cases&amp;tos=TOS03\_ccp00010&amp;solution=solution\_prefix&amp;taskId=task\_Id
</code></p>
