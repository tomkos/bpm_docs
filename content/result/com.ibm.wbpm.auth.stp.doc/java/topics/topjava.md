# Opening the Java or Java 2 Platform Enterprise
Edition perspective

## About this task

You can use the Business Integration perspective to navigate
through Java and Java 2 Platform Enterprise
Edition resources and to open the various Java and
Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition editors, which is probably all
you need to do for most tasks. However, not everything will be found
with the Business Integration perspective. For some purposes, especially
debugging code, you might find another perspective useful.

To
open the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition perspective or one of
the Java perspectives, follow these steps:

## Procedure

1. From the menu, select Window > Open Perspective > Other.
2. Select J2EE or one of the Java perspectives, and click OK.

## What to do next

The opened perspectives are shown at the upper-right corner
of the workbench window. You can switch to the Business Integration
perspective by clicking the Business Integration perspective button,
as shown in this image:
