Use the Process Designer unless
you are updating artifacts that you can edit only in the traditional desktop Process Designer.
The web editor opens by default when you click the Open
in Designer link in Workflow Center to
open a process application or a toolkit.

You can view the concurrent activity, users who are viewing and editing artifacts, in the current
project as you work on it by clicking on the user presence indicator  in the bottom-right corner of the web Process Designer window.

- You cannot edit a library item that another user is currently
editing; you have read-only access to it.
- You see the changes of the other users when their edits are saved.

- Where to edit Process Designer artifacts

The desktop Process Designer is deprecated. Use the newer Process Designer in a browser unless you are updating artifacts that you can edit only in the traditional desktop Process Designer.
- Saving your changes in IBM Process Designer

When you work in the desktop Process Designer, you must explicitly save your changes. When you work in the Process Designer, you have the option to save your changes as you make them.
- Determining artifact usage

View artifact dependencies, such as the artifacts that use a particular library item and the artifacts that the library item uses in process applications and across toolkits.
- Setting preferences in the Process Designer

Customize your Process Designer environment and control how several functional elements work by setting your user preferences.
