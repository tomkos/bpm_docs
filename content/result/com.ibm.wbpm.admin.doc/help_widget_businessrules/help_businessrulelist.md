# Business Rules

The
Business Rules widget displays business rules within a hierarchy that starts from the business rule
group. Each business rule group contains business rule sets, which in turn contain if-then rules
that determine the business logic. Some if-then rules have parameters that you can change to
influence the performance of your business. When moved over a parameter, the cursor changes, and the
parameter is displayed as a field that you can edit or change.
