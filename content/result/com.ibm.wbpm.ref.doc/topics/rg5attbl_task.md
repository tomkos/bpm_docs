# TASK\_AUDIT\_LOG view

Inline tasks are logged in the AUDIT\_LOG\_B view. All other
task types are logged in the TASK\_AUDIT\_LOG view. Depending on the
choices made in IBMÂ® Integration
Designer, inline human tasks can also trigger Common Event Infrastructure
(CEI) events to be emitted for Business Flow Manager staff activity
events and Human Task Manager task events.

Audit events are
related to task entities. The audit event types depend on the entity
to which the event refers. The audit event types include:

- Task instance events (TIE)
- Task template events (TTE)
- Escalation instance events (EIE)

The following table describes the TASK\_AUDIT\_LOG view.
