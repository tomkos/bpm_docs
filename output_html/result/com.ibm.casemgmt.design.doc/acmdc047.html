<h1>Preparing for solution migration</h1>

<ul>
<li>Identifying solution assets for migration</li>
</ul>

<p>Solution assets are components that comprise a solution, such as definition files, workflow collections, and pages. When you migrate your solution from one environment to another, you must ensure that you migrate all of the assets that are associated with your solution.
- Preparing customized migration and deployment instructions</p>

<p>To prepare for migration, create a comprehensive set of instructions that are tailored for your environment and solution applications. The instructions serve as a roadmap for the process to follow when you migrate a solution application from the development environment to a test or production environment.
- Preparing the system configuration for migration</p>

<p>When a solution application is migrated to and deployed into a system for the first time, additional steps might be required to configure the new target environment.</p>
