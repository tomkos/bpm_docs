# Creating interfaces

- Interfaces

An interface provides the input and output of a component. It is created independent of the internal implementation of the component.
- Interface editor

You create interfaces with the interface editor. How you use the interface editor to create interfaces and work with interfaces is discussed in this section.
- Developing interfaces: top-down

Top-down development means building the entire interface yourself, meaning you have no initial interface.
- Developing interfaces: bottom-up

Bottom-up development means starting with an interface that was created outside of IBMÂ® Integration Designer, importing it into a module and then, if necessary, modifying it in the interface editor.
- Developing interfaces: meet-in-the-middle

Meet-in-the-middle development means taking an already created interface and adding it to a component that has been implemented but has no interface.
- Binding style

The binding style specifies how a service is bound to a messaging protocol, particularly the SOAP protocol. Binding style is also referred to as the WSDL style or encoding style.
- Using document binding style with multipart messages

Multipart messages used with the document binding style require some knowledge of the WS-I standard.
- Inline schemas

Inline schemas are a way of including the schema within a WSDL file rather than specifying that it be imported.
