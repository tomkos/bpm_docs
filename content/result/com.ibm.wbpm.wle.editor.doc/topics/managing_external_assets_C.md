# Updating or replacing managed files

## Before you begin

Although the following
instructions describe how to update or replace managed files in Process Designer, you can also update
or replace files using the BPMUpdateFile command, as described in the topic BPMUpdateFile command.

## Procedure

To update managed files:

1. Make your changes to the file as needed, and then save
the file.
2. In the designer library, click Files and open the file that you want to
update or replace.
3. In the File section, click Browse and find the
updated file. Then, click Upload.
The contents of the original file are replaced with the contents of the updated file. Although
updates cannot be reversed, you can restore the original contents by re-uploading them. To update
the contents of the file, browse and select a file that has the replacement content, and click the
Upload button. All current implementations of the files throughout your
project are also automatically updated.
