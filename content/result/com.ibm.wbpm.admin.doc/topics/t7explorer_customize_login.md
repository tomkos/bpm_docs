# Customizing the Business Process Choreographer Explorer or
Business Process Archive Explorer navigation pane and default login
view

## About this task

For example, you might have BPEL processes that are based
on state machines. Because the default user interface does not include
views for working with state machines, you can add views for process
templates and process instances that are based on state machines.

To customize the navigation pane and the default login view, complete
the following steps.

## Procedure

1. Click Customize in the taskbar.
2. In the Customize Navigation Tree and Login View page, select the views to include in and clear the views to remove
from the navigation pane.
3. Select the view that your users see when they log in to
the instance of the client. The list contains the views
that you selected in the previous step and any customized views that
you created or imported from the Manage Views page.
4. To save your changes, click Save. The predefined views appear with icons in front
of them in the navigation pane. You can change the position of these
views in the list.
5. Optional: To return the views for this instance
to the default views, click Restore defaults.  This action resets the navigation pane to the list
of predefined views. Customized views in the navigation pane are not
affected by this action.
