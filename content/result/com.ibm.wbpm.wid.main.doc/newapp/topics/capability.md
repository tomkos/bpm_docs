# Business integration capabilities

IBMÂ® Integration
Designer provides a filtering
function known as capabilities. With capabilities, you can choose to hide tools not used during
business integration application development. At any time, you can choose to show those tools again.

IBM Integration
Designer supports a range of
servers and runtime deployment environments. Tools are grouped into predefined categories called
capabilities according to the target runtime that they support. You use capabilities to
filter your development environment, so that you see only the tools that you need. In order to
access a tool, its capability must be enabled.

When you install Integration Designer, you are asked to
select a runtime environment. The capability that corresponds to your selection is enabled. The
first time you start IBM Integration
Designer, the tools
that are part of that capability are available, and the other tools are hidden. The
Getting Started page is also customized according to the runtime (and
capability) that you selected during installation. You can enable or disable capabilities at any
time according to your needs.

Use
this capability if you want to work with business processes created in IBM Process
Designer and the IBM Workflow
Center repository. Also use this capability
if you want to work with applications that targeted IBM Workflow
Server in previous releases.
