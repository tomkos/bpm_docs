<h1>Adding and selecting roles</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>You can add roles to a new solution by using
the solution wizard or by using the solution home page. If you add
roles to a new solution by using the solution wizard, each role is
assigned a default personal in-basket and a role in-basket. To add
or associate other in-baskets with a role, complete the wizard and
open the solution.</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To add a role from the solution home page:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Roles page of the solution home page, click Add
Role.</li>
<li>Specify a role name and optionally a description.
The role name must be 55 characters or less and it cannot start with the tilde (~) special
character. The role name cannot use the same name as a task in the same solution.</li>
<li>Select the type of personal in-basket and the user features to display for the role in
Case Client. For more
information, see Configuring in-baskets for roles.</li>
<li>Optional: 
To assign a manager to your role, from the Manager for this
role list, select the role that you want to designate as a manager. The
members of the manager team will be able to manage the work of your case team.</li>
<li>On the Pages tab, assign the solution page for the role, then
click OK.</li>
<li>Configure the in-baskets for the role.
For more information, see Configuring in-baskets for roles and Adding custom in-baskets to roles.</li>
<li>Associate the role with task steps by adding a step and assigning it to a role in the
Step Designer. 
Tip: You can also manage roles from the Case Client. For more information, see Managing access to cases.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What to do next</h2>

<ul>
<li>Roles in solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>You define roles at the solution level. You then associate roles with steps in tasks. You assign users and groups to roles in the Case Client to specify which users can access a particular task or step.
- Solution pages for roles</p>

<p>Solution pages provide case workers with access to cases and work items that are in a solution. By default, two classic solution pages, Cases and Work, are used for every role.
- Configuring in-baskets for roles</p>

<p>An in-basket lists the steps for the cases in a solution. (In Case Client, the steps that are defined for a task are called work items). In Case Builder you can configure one or more in-baskets for a role.
- Adding custom in-baskets to roles</p>

<p>You can add new in-baskets to existing queues from IBM® FileNet® Process Designer into your solution. For example, you might want to provide different views of a queue, such as loan applications for over or under certain amounts, for different purposes.</p>
