# Performing administrative tasks for inbound events

## About this task

Information about developing and installing event handlers is
found in the following topics:

- Creating an event handler for an Enterprise Content Management system

To obtain information about content events that occur on an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) server, you must install an event handler on the ECM system. The event handler notifies the IBM® Business Automation Workflow system of the events by calling the appropriate IBM BPM APIs. These events can be received by processes on your IBM Business Automation Workflow system.
- Using the event handler for FileNet Content Manager

You can deploy the event handler on a IBM FileNet® Content Manager system, and configure it to provide notification events to your Business Automation Workflow processes.
