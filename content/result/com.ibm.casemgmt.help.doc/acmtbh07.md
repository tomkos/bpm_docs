# Case type validation errors

## Symptoms

## Causes

- Case Builder does not
create a Global XPDL file until the first save of the solution. Therefore,
case type validation fails.
- Case Builder does not keep the
Business Automation Workflow information
until the solution is saved for the first time. Therefore, Case Builder cannot find the Business Automation Workflow information to validate
the process task.
