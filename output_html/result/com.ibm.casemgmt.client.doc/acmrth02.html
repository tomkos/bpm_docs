<h1>Adding new activities for a case</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<ul>
<li>Automatic workflow activities are started automatically.</li>
<li>Manual workflow activities are started manually. Tip: Using the added support for
workflow process activities that are designated as manual, you can start a process activity by
clicking Start in the Activities tab of the Case
Information widget. If the process has a launch UI, the launch UI page is automatically opened when
the activity is started.</li>
<li>Discretionary workflow activities typically are used for activities that are routinely performed
for a case but might not be performed regularly. These activities are predefined for a solution, but
are not automatically added to cases. Instead, you add discretionary workflow activities to a case
only as necessary.</li>
<li><p>Custom workflow activities address activities that are not typically part of a case. You can
define these activities to meet specific case requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding discretionary workflow activities</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Discretionary workflow activities are defined for specific types of cases. Typically, they are used for situations that happen frequently, but not as part of every case. For example, a discretionary workflow activity might be used to initiate a fraud investigation for an insurance claim. The work items that are required to complete this investigation are predefined for the discretionary workflow activity.
- Adding discretionary to-do tasks</p>

<p>Discretionary to-do tasks are defined for specific types of cases. Typically, they are used for simple activities that are not associated with a workflow and that happen frequently, but not as part of every case. For example, a discretionary to-do task might be used to record the completion of making contact by telephone with a client.
- Adding quick tasks</p>

<p>Quick tasks are simple activities that you define and add to a case. You can use quick tasks to organize your work, track one-time tasks, or similar activities. For example, you might create a quick task to make a follow-up call to a client or to locate files that are needed for the case.
- Adding custom activities</p>

<p>You can add a custom activity for an activity that is not handled by the discretionary activities that are predefined for a case. For example, you might add a custom activity to review a document that is not typically associated with a case.</p>
