# Stepping through component instances in the integration debugger

## About this task

- Resuming component thread execution in the integration debugger

- Terminating component instances in the integration debugger

In the Debug perspective, you can terminate the execution of all component instances except for business processes and business state machines. Terminating one or more component instances may be necessary in some situations rather than letting the instances exit naturally as a result of your debugging tasks.
