# Comparing and opening snapshots in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

## Procedure

To compare snapshots:

1. Open the process application or toolkit in the desktop Process Designer.
The current snapshot (tip) opens. All the snapshots of the process
application or toolkit are listed under Revision History.
2. To view new or changed library items in each snapshot,
click the circle icon in the Revision History header. Note: To
return to the list of snapshots, click the snapshot icon in the Revision
History header.
3. To view the state of an entire process application or toolkit
as of a particular snapshot, click the icon next to the snapshot in
the Revision History. The snapshot opens in read-only mode.
The Designer displays a message in the toolbar to indicate that it
is showing the contents of the entire process application as they
existed when the snapshot was created. While this message is displayed,
you can examine the library contents, but you cannot make changes.
4. To get back to the current state of your process application
or toolkit, click the icon next to the message.
