# Creating a new XML map

## About this task

- Creating an XML map from the File menu

You can launch the XML map editor from the File menu, and define mappings between input and output business objects. An XML map that you create in this manner can reside in a module, mediation module, or library.
- Creating an XML map in a Mapping transformation primitive

While working in the mediation flow editor, you can launch the XML map editor from a Mapping transformation primitive to create an XML map between the input and output message. When the map has been created, an XSL style sheet will be generated to perform the transformation at run time. If you want to create a new XML map for a Mapping primitive but an XML map already exists, you can use the Properties view of the mediation flow editor to create the new XML map and simultaneously choose whether to have the existing XML map overridden, deleted, or retained.
