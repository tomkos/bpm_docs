# Administering access to WSRR

## Before you begin

## About this task

WSRR definitions, and their connection properties, are the mechanism used to connect to a
registry instance and look up a web service or a mediation policy. WSRR is installed as an
enterprise application and provides a web service interface that allows you to connect Endpoint
Lookup mediation primitives and Policy Resolution mediation primitives to a registry instance (as
part of a mediation flow). You can use the Endpoint Lookup mediation primitive to look up services,
and the Policy Resolution mediation primitive to find mediation policies. To display a list of all
your WSRR definitions, use the administrative console to complete the following step.
