# Starting Workplace

## Deployment options

- When Workplace is
available as a toolkit and wrapped with a process application, it is implemented as a set of Workplace toolkit and UI toolkit views that are combined in a
client-side human service, and can be accessed from any build:
https://{baw-server-host}/Workplace
- When Workplace is
provided as a process application that runs in the Application Engine, it runs as a desktop in the
Business Automation Navigator, which is the
single public entry point in IBMÂ® Cloud Pak for Business
Automation:https://{navigator\_hostname}/icn/navigator/?desktop=workplace

## Search capabilities

Depending on the environment, Workplace includes the following
search capabilities.
