# BPMShowSnapshot command

Use the BPMShowSnapshot command in
connected mode from either a Workflow Center server
or Workflow Server to
return detailed information about a snapshot or tip, including any
dependencies.

The BPMShowSnapshot command
is run using the AdminTask object of the wsadmin scripting client.

## Prerequisites

- In a network deployment environment,
you must run this command on the node containing the application cluster
member that handles Workflow Server or Workflow Center applications.
Do not run this command from the deployment manager profile.
- Run the command in the connected mode; that is,
do not use the wsadmin -conntype none option.
- To access the wsadmin command, the ID being used
must have a WebSphereÂ® Application
Server role
with more privileges than the monitor role. See Administrative roles for information about
roles.
- To access the Business Automation Workflow API used
by this command, the ID being used must belong to either the bpmAdminGroup
or bpmAuthorGroup. The default name for the bpmAdminGroup is tw\_admins
and the default name for the bpmAuthorGroup is tw\_authors. See IBM Business Automation Workflow default group types for information about groups.Tip: By default, only the DeAdmin user has both the WebSphere Application
Server administrator
role and membership in the bpmAdminGroup.
