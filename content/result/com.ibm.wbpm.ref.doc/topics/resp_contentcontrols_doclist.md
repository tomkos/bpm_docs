# Responsive Document List view (deprecated)

For information about how to map deprecated functions to UI functions, see the topic Mapping deprecated functions to UI functions.

Assuming that they have the appropriate permissions, users can add new documents. From the
actions column, user can select an action to perform on the document. You can set configuration
options so that users can create new documents, update existing documents, view the revisions made
to the document, and delete the document.

| Action    | Description                                                                                                                       |

| View      | Displays the contents of the document in the browser or, if the browser does not support the file format, downloads the document. |
| Update    | Replaces the file contents and updates its properties.                                                                            |
| Revisions | Shows the versions of the document.                                                                                               |
| Delete    | Removes the document.                                                                                                             |

## Integrating with an Enterprise Content Management server

To integrate the Responsive Document List with an Enterprise
Content Management (ECM) server, the process application must have a connection to that server. See
Adding an Enterprise Content Management server. For information about building ECM services, see Building a service that integrates with an ECM system or a BPM store. For additional information, see the topics under Enabling document support.
