# Federating business process management systems

- Enabling indexing on a federated system

The federated data repository, which is a distributed index for Process Federation Server, enables process participants to see consolidated lists of BPD-, BPEL- and Case-related tasks and instances from all the business process management systems in the federated environment. For data from a federated system to appear in the index, you must enable indexing on the system.
- Adding a Business Automation Workflow system to the federated environment

The server.xml template file that is provided with Process Federation Server contains sample elements that you can use as the basis for adding a business process management system to the federated environment.
- Importing saved searches from federated systems into Process Federation Server

With Process Federation Server Saved Search Transfer REST API, you can now export saved searches from federated systems and import them into Process Federation Server.
- Configuration properties for federated systems

The server.xml configuration file on Process Federation Server contains properties for each business process management system in the federated environment and its associated index.
