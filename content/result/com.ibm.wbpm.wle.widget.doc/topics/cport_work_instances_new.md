- Working on activities in Process Portal

A process instance can contain required and optional activities, and they can be started automatically, such as when a document is filed, or started manually.
- Resolving issues with process instances by using the Gantt chart

 Traditional: 
  To identify issues with process instances that are in progress, you can use the Process Performance dashboard in Process Portal. You can then use the Gantt charts for individual instances to resolve these issues, for example, by adjusting task due dates or priorities or changing the path through the outstanding tasks.
