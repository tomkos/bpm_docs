The item is not removed from the target object store or the Content Platform Engine.  Remove any unused roles or in-baskets by using the Process Configuration Console. When you redeploy the solution, IBM® Business Automation Workflow does not remove properties or business objects from the case type definition class in the target object store. As a result, these items continue to appear in existing cases and are available when caseworker  create new cases of the case type. All active work items that reference case properties also continue to display the property values. |
