# View properties

When you select a view in a layout, the properties that describe that view instance are
displayed. The general, positioning, visibility, and HTML attribute properties are common to all
view instances. The configuration properties are defined in the view definition and are specific to
views that are bound to that definition.

- View general properties

The general properties of a view set general text information such as the instance label and binding information such as the data binding and view definition binding.
- Positioning options for view instances

You can control the spacing of the views in your coaches or custom views by setting the positioning properties for each view instance. The values that you set can be absolute, for example in millimeters, or relative, for example as a percentage of the available display space.
- Configuration properties and configuration options

You define the configuration options in your view so that users can customize a specific instance of that view. Users see these configuration options as configuration properties in that instance.
- User-defined events

You can use a new event framework and tools to develop user-defined events that leverage the programming extensions of the framework for custom views. And you can run your business logic from any of the event handlers. This methodology enables event handlers to react to numerous types of events, regardless of whether the events are triggered programmatically or by devices or user actions.
- View visibility properties

The Visibility properties specify where you set how the parent coach or view displays the view instance.
- HTML attributes

The HTML Attributes page is where you override styles for a specific view instance.
