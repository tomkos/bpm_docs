# Installing a case solution by using REST APIs

## Before you begin

details icon of the case solution you want to install.
2. On the Snapshots tab, click the export link of the snapshot.
3. Select the IBMÂ® Business Automation

Package (.zip) option and then click Export.

## Procedure

The following steps use the IBM BPM
Explorer ops to run the installation by using REST APIs, although you can use any REST client to run
the APIs:

1. Go to IBM BPM Explorer ops on
https://host\_name:port\_number/ops/explorer. The server address
must be the URL of Workflow Server.
2. Under System, run the POST /system/login REST API with the
login\_request parameter, using the example values.
For more information, see the REST API reference.
3. Click Try it out to run the REST API.
4 Under Container, run the POST /std/bpm/containers/install REST API withthese parameters:
    - BPMCSRFToken - The value returned from the /system/login
call.
    - install\_file - The .zip file you exported for your snapshot.
    - inactive - Deactivates the snapshot after you install it. This parameter is
false by default.
    - caseDosName - The name of the case design object store. You can get this
from your administrator.
    - caseProjectArea - The target environment or project area for case
artifacts. You can omit this value if the default project area is defined. You can get this from
your administrator.
    - caseOverwrite - Set this parameter to true.
5. Click Try it out to run the REST API.
6 To determine when the case solution has been installed, run the GET/std/bpm/containers/{container}/versions/{version} REST API with these parameters:

- BPMCSRFToken - The value returned from the /system/login call.
- container - The acronym for the case solution.
- version - The acronym for the snapshot being installed.
7. Click Try it out to run the REST API.
