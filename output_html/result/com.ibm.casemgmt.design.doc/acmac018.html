<h1>Creating a solution from a template by using the command line</h1>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>If you are a business analyst and want to create a basic
solution from a template, you can use Case Builder. However, if you create
a solution in Case Builder,
you do not have the option to preserve the unique identifiers of any
of the objects in the solution.</p>

<p>Creating a solution from a template
applies only in the development environment.</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To create a solution from a template:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the current directory to the
install_root/CaseManagement/configure directory, where
install_root is the location where Business Automation Workflow is
installed.</li>
<li>Generate the text input file by running the following command.
Do not enter any line breaks when you enter the command:</li>
</ol>

<p>configmgr_cl generate_input_sa -operation createFromTemplate 
 -file input_file_name
[-help]</p>

<p>-file input_file_name
Specifies the full path to the text input file to create. The
directory structure in the path must exist. You can use any valid
file name, but the .txt extension is recommended.
For example, use -file C:\solutions\from_template_input.txt.</p>

<p>-help 
Optional: Shows a brief message on the command syntax instead of running the command.</p>

<p>For example, the following command
creates the C:\solutions\from_template_input.txt input
file:configmgr_cl generate_input_sa -operation createFromTemplate 
 -file C:\solutions\from_template_input.txt
3 Edit the property values in the input_file_name file.
    1. Open the input_file_name file
in a text editor.
    2. Provide a value for each property in the file.
For
example, enter the Content Platform Engine server
WSI URL value: </p>

<p>CEWS_URI=http://myserver:9080/wsi/FNCEWS40MTOMYou
can specify whether unique identifiers are preserved when solutions
are created from the template later on by providing a value for the
preserveIdentifier property. </p>

<p>Important: Ensure that the
preserveIdentifier value is set to the same value that is set in the
template unless you have a specific business reason to override the
template. If you enter preserveIdentifier=true,
do not deploy more than one solution that is made from this template
to the same target object store.
    3. Save and close the input file.
4. Apply the values in the text input file by running the
following command. Do not enter any line breaks when you enter the
command:</p>

<p>configmgr_cl execute_sa -operation createFromTemplate 
 -file input_file_name</p>
