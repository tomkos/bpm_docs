# Defining a screen reader for the help system

Users with special needs may want to access the documentation
in a screen reader rather than in the embedded help system. You can
set the help system to open in a screen reader by default. If you
set this preference, the Samples Gallery and the Tutorials Gallery
will also open in a screen reader.
