# Integration Designer prompts for connection information whenever
a process application is imported

If you
can obtain the user name and password for the deployment manager from
your system administrator, specify the user name and password in the User
ID and Password field in the dialog
box and then click Finish. Otherwise, click Cancel.

If
you cannot obtain the user name and password from your system administrator,
complete the following steps before you connect to Process Center
to prevent the dialog box from opening:

1. From the Window menu, select Preferences.
The Preferences window opens.
2. Expand Business Integration and select Process
Center.
3. Clear the Automatically create a Process Center server
when needed check box.
4. Click OK.

If you are unable to specify the administrative user name
and password, you cannot create a Process Center server and test your
process applications there. However, you can still test the process
application modules on a UTE server.
