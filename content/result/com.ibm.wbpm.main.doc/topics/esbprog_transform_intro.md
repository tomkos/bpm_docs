# Data Transformation

- Business Object Map and Mapping mediation primitives

There can be structural differences in the types of data within the source and target XML message body type.
- Custom mediation

There are cases where it is difficult to represent the necessary data transformation using a BO Mapper or Mapping mediation primitive. In these circumstances, you can use a Custom mediation.
- Message Element Setter and Data Handler mediation primitives

In addition to the BO Mapper, Mapping and Custom mediation primitives, there are other data transformation mediation primitives available within IBM Business Automation Workflow. These transformation primitives do not change the entire message structure of the SMO, they transform the content of a particular subsection of the message.
- WebSphere Transformation Extender

WebSphereÂ® Transformation Extender (WebSphere TX) is a separately licensed product and is not included as part of IBM Workflow Server. Using WebSphere TX, you can create maps that can transform data between a wide variety of formats.
