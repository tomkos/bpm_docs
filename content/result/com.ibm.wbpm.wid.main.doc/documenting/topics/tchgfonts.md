# Changing fonts

Default fonts are specified for you, but if you want to
customize the appearance of your reports, you can change the fonts
used for various text entities. If you want to change the fonts that
are used in the generated documentation, launch the Documentation
Generation wizard and click Next until you
have the Layout Settings page.

## About this task

To change the fonts used in the generated generate documentation,
follow these instructions:

## Procedure

1. Select the Overwrite Default Fonts check
box. The Fonts button will be enabled.
2. Click Fonts and the Documentation
Style Settings page opens. Change fonts as required. If the font you
want to use is not available, continue to step 3 to add a new font.
3. Click Manage fonts and the Manage
Documentation Fonts window opens. Use the buttons to add fonts to
the list or remove them from the list.
4. Click the Add button. The Add Documentation
Font window opens.
5. Click Browse to get the Open window
and locate the .ttf or .ttc file and select it.  Note: (Windows only) If you want to
select fonts from the Windows directory,
for example, WINNT or WINDOWS, you must retype the name of the .ttf
or .ttc file in the Open window. By default, if you double-click the
file in the WINNT directory, Windows opens
the TTF or TTC file instead of selecting it, so to make a selection,
you need to type the name. To use the mouse for this selection, copy
the TTF or TTC file to another directory. Then, you will be able to
use the mouse to click and select the font file.
If a TTC
file is selected, a valid font name must be entered.
Select Create
CID-keyed font metrics for fonts with large character
sets, such as for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean language fonts.
6. Click OK in the Documentation Font
window to complete the selection. You should see the new font in the
Manage Documentation Fonts window. Note: In the Documentation
Generation wizard, names of registered fonts, including double-byte
character set font names, are displayed only in Latin letters.
7. Click OK to go back to the Documentation
Style Settings page where you can now select the new font for the
listed types of text.

## Results

The new font is now registered, which makes it available
for all subsequent documentation generations. Default fonts cannot
be removed.
