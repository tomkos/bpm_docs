# Task Toolbar widget

The Task Toolbar widget is included in the Process Task Details Adapter page by default. However,
you can add the Task Toolbar widget to any page.

You can edit the settings of the Task Toolbar widget to control whether the following information
is  displayed in the header information:

- Task name
- Process instance name
- Parent case title (ID)
- Task due date

When the process instance name is displayed, it includes a link that opens the Process Instances
view and displays it in its own Case tab. The associated process diagram is also displayed in its
own Case tab.

When the parent case title (ID) is displayed, it includes a link that opens the parent case in
the Case Details page.

1. On the Pages tab of Case Builder, expand Task Details pages and click the Process Task Details
Adapter link to open the page in Page Designer.
2. In Page Designer, click the Edit Settings icon of the Task Toolbar
widget.
3. In the Task Toolbar dialog box, ensure that the check boxes are selected for the header
information that you want to display, and then click OK.
