<h1>Split Case Properties widget</h1>

<p>The Split Case Properties widget is included on the Split
Case page. The widget displays the properties for the case
type that is selected for the new case. For properties that match,
the values are populated with the values from the original case. The
case worker can edit these values as needed for the new case.</p>

<p>The behavior of the Split Case Properties widget is the same as
the Properties widget.</p>

<ul>
<li>Split Case Properties widget events</li>
</ul>

<p>The Split Case Properties widget handles incoming events to enable a user to create a case by reusing property values from an existing case.</p>
