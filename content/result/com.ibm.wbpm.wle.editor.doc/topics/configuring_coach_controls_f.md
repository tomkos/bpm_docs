# Making an input control a required field in a heritage coach (deprecated)

## Procedure

1. Open the service that contains the heritage coach that you want to work with and then click the
Coaches tab.
2. Click the heritage coach control that you want to make a required input area.
3. Click the Visibility option in the properties.
By default, input controls are visible to and can be edited by everyone. The Visibility
properties enable you to restrict what process participants see in the runtime heritage coach, and
under what conditions they see it.
4. Select the Override Parent Visibility check
box. Doing so allows you to change the default Visibility properties.
5. From the Default Visibility list,
select the Required (full access) for everyone option.
6. Optional: Clear the Override Parent
Visibility check box to set the Visibility properties
back to read-only mode.
7. Run the service to test the runtime heritage coach.
If you leave the required input text box empty and then click Next, the
input text box is shown in a different color and you are not able to end the task successfully until
you supply the required input.
