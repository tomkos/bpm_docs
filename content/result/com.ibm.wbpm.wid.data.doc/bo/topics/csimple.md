# SimpleType support in the business object editor

The new business object wizard provides this functionality.

In the Properties view, the Inherit from field
can only be changed to other simple types.

Note that fields can not actually be added to the simpleType
in the business object editor. The editor maintains the restrictions
that align with the XSD complex and simple type definitions.
