<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>When you deploy a solution that contains rules, the
following error message is returned:</p>

rules could not be deployed because of the following error: A transaction
problem has occurred. Message was: ; nested exception is: com.ibm.websphere.csi.CSITransactionRolledbackException:

The previous error was caused by: A transaction problem has occurred.
Message was: ; nested exception is: com.ibm.websphere.csi.CSITransactionRolledbackException:
Transaction marked rollbackonly</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<h2>Resolving the problem</h2>

<ol>
<li>Go to the Application servers &gt; server1 &gt; Transaction service page in the WebSphereÂ® Application
Server administrative console.</li>
<li>Increase the value of the Total transaction lifetime timeout setting to a
higher value, such as 300 seconds.</li>
