# Audit logging for business rules and selectors

You can configure your server to automatically detect when changes are made to business rules and
selectors, and create an entry in a log file detailing the changes.

- name of the person making the change
- location from where the change request originated
- old business rule or selector object
- new business rule or selector replacing the old object
