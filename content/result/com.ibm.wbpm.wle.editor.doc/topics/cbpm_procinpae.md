# Creating BPDs in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

- Creating a business process definition (BPD) (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
To model a process, you must create a business process definition (BPD). A BPD is a reusable model of a process that defines the common aspects of all runtime instances of that process model.
- Running and debugging processes in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
The Inspector in the desktop IBM Process Designer is key to an iterative approach to process development. Using the Inspector, individual developers can run processes and services on the Workflow Center server or remote runtime process servers.
- Building services in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Use services to implement the activities in a business process definition (BPD). When a BPD starts and the tasks within it are invoked, services perform the required functions.
- Enabling users to perform ad hoc actions (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
Use an ad hoc event when you need to include ad hoc actions that can be run at any time during process execution.
- Documenting development artifacts in the desktop Process Designer (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
As you develop your process application, you might want to capture information about the artifacts that you are creating. Each artifact in IBM Process Designer has a documentation field for this purpose. You can enter text or links to external resources such as web sites or attachments.
- Using external implementations in BPDs (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
You can create external implementations for activities that are handled by applications outside of IBM Business Automation Workflow. For example, you can model an activity that is run by a custom Eclipse RCP or Microsoft .NET application, or provides an alternative task completion user interface that can be launched from Process Portal.
- Integrating with web services, Java, and databases

You can configure Business Automation Workflow processes to communicate with an external system to retrieve, update, or insert data. And, external applications can call into Business Automation Workflow to initiate services. You can manage inbound and outbound communication with external systems using undercover agents, web services, and integration services.
- Integrating BPDs with IBM Business Automation Workflow cases (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
To integrate with IBM Business Automation Workflow, you build an integration service and perform other key steps when you want to integrate a business process developed in IBM Process Designer with a case management case in IBM Business Automation Workflow.
- Upgrading BPDs from IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5 and earlier (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
You can upgrade business process definitions (BPDs) that you created in releases of IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.5 and earlier to use functions that were added in later releases, such as data change management for instance UIs.
