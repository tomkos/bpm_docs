# Monitoring system performance

The System Dashboard for Enterprise Content Management displays real-time
performance data that you can use to proactively identify and resolve potential performance problems
before they occur. The performance data can also be archived for management reporting and trend
analysis.

As the administrator, you monitor work items, case activities, and other processes that run in
the background, and if they fail to launch, you need to manually intervene to recover them. If a
workflow is in the malfunction state, the work item will be sent to either the predefined
Malfunction submap or a user-defined malfunction submap. You can use Process Administrator to
monitor the Conductor queue (for the predefined Malfunction map, configured by default) or your
customized malfunction queue.

The solution can have an IT administrator role with access to Content Platform Engine tools. The IT administrator
can use either Process Administrator or Process Tracker to move the work items out of the
malfunction state. The Process Administrator or Process Tracker can be launched from the Standalone
FileNet® Process
Designer. Currently
only the basic authentication is supported for the Standalone FileNet Process
Designer.

See the IBM
FileNet P8 documentation for instructions
on installing, configuring, and using the System Dashboard for Enterprise Content Management, as well as for retrieving
queued items in the malfunction state.
