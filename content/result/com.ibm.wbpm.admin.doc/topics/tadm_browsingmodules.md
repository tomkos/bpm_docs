# Browsing and administering modules

## Before you begin

- If you are using a deployment environment, ensure the deployment manager is running before you
use the widget. In addition, the node agents must be running in order to see module status in the
widget.
- If you have turned on security in your business space, make sure you are using both
administrative security and application security.
- If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer as your browser, configure it to display new
versions of pages instead of cached versions. See Caching problem in
default configuration of Microsoft Internet Explorer for more information.

Required security role for this task: When administrative security is enabled, you must be
logged in with an administrative role (Administrator, Configurator, Operator, Monitor,
AdminsecurityManager, Deployer, or icsadmins) to view and administer modules.

## About this task

For each module in the cell, you can see a list of artifacts associated with it in the Module
Browser widget, including service exports, service imports, properties, policies, and service
control points. If you are using IBMÂ® Workflow
Server,
you can also see BPEL processes, human tasks, business rules, business state machines, business
calendars and security roles for the module.

The related Module Administration widget displays a graphical representation of module service
exports and service imports and provides administrative access to module artifacts.

To browse for a module and examine its details, perform the following steps.

## Procedure

1. Log in to your business space and open the page that contains the Module Browser and Module
Administration widgets.
The Module Browser widget lists all of the modules currently deployed to the
cell.
2 Optional: If you want to display only a subset of modules, complete the following steps.
    1. From the menu on the widget toolbar, click Edit Settings.
    2. Select Show selected modules, and click Add.
    3. In the Select Modules to Add window, select the names of modules that you want to show in the
Module Browser widget.
In the Search modules text box, you can type the first few letters of
the name of a module, and the list of modules in the window is refreshed with only the modules that
begin with those letters.
    4. After selecting all modules that you want to show in the Module Browser widget, click
Add.
The Module Browser widget displays the specific modules you selected.
3. Browse the list of modules to locate the one you want to see in detail.
4 Click the arrow next to the module name to expand the tree view. The widget displays the following information about the module:

- Service imports and service exports in the module
- Whether properties and policies have been defined for the module
- Business rule groups defined in the module
- BPEL processes defined in the module
- Business state machines defined in the module
- Human tasks defined in the module
- Business calendars defined in the module
- Security roles defined for the module (available only when administrative
security and application security are enabled)
- Service control points defined for the module
