# Getting started with Business
Process Choreographer Explorer and Business Process Archive Explorer

## About this task

Both client interfaces offer a search function that you
can use to discover BPEL processes and their related activities and
human tasks that meet specific criteria. For example, you can check
the status of these instances, navigate between related instances
and templates, and retrieve a graphical view of the process structure
and process states, which includes the associated activities and human
tasks.

- If you are in the Business Process Choreographer system monitor
role, you can browse all the BPEL process instances and human tasks,
and also view their details.
- If you are in the Business Process Choreographer system administrator
role, you can manage the lifecycle of BPEL processes and human tasks,
repair BPEL processes, and manage work assignments.
- If you are a business user, you can use Business Process Choreographer
Explorer to work with your assigned tasks, flag your absence and define
substitutes.

- If you are in the Business Process Choreographer system monitor
role, you can browse all the BPEL process instances and human tasks
that are in the archive database, and also view their details.
- If you are in the Business Process Choreographer system administrator
role, you can browse, view, and delete BPEL process instances and
human tasks that are in the archive database.
- If you are neither in the administrator role nor the monitor role,
you can only see instances that you started or initiated. You cannot
view any details about the instances. That is, the only views that
show any content are available from the Views tab by clicking Process Instances > Started By Me or Task Instances > Initiated By Me.
