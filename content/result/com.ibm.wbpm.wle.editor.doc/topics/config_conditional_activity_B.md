The following table lists the available JavaScript API properties.

| Property                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| tw.system.process.conditionalActivities         | Finds all conditional activities in a process.. Returns a list of items of the ConditionalActivity variable type. You can use this property to construct a coach that specifies the conditional activities that you want to run in the current process instance.                                                                                          |
| tw.system.process.selectedConditionalActivities | Returns a list of identifiers for the conditional activities that are to be run at run time. You can set the value of this property by providing a list of conditional activity IDs to be selected. This property also accepts a comma-separated string of IDs, which is the output format from the conditional activity coach that is described earlier. |
| tw.system.step.isConditionalActivitySelected    | Determines whether the current step is a conditional activity that is selected for execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| tw.system.process.guid                          | Returns the ID of the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| tw.system.step.guid                             | Returns the ID of the step or activity that is running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
