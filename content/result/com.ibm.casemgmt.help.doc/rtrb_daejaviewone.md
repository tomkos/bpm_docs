# Annotations might not be saved automatically in IBM Business Automation
Workflow when
annotationAutoSave is set to true

## Symptoms

- When you close the screen using the X button, the annotations are
automatically saved without any prompts.
- When you close the case that contains the document, annotations are not automatically saved, but
instead you are prompted to cancel the close action to save the document changes or discard
them.
