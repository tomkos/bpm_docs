# Profile-specific log files

There are a number of log files that are created for each profile.
Some of these logs describe the parameters used for the creation of
the profile. These types of log files generally remain unchanged once
the profile is fully configured. Other profile-specific logs are continually
updated to capture error, warning, and information messages emitted
during run time.

The following table specifies the different types of profile-specific log files and the locations
where you can find them within the product. Within the table, the variable
installation\_root represents the installation directory of IBM® Business Automation Workflow. The variable profile\_root
represents the root location of a profile.

For more information, see Installation directories for the product and profiles.

Text files - dmgr\_hex\_id\_date\_time.txt.    Managed-node profile: Log file(s) - nodeagent\_exception.log and server\_name\_exception.log.
