# Installing and configuring IBM Business Automation
Workflow
with a new Db2 database
server

Using the typical installation option, you can install Db2 on Linux on Intel systems, and configure the
required databases for IBM Business Automation
Workflow. If you are
installing on Linux for z or Linux on Power, use the instructions for installing onto and
configuring an existing database. Select the typical installation only if you have administrative
privileges (are a root user) and do not have an existing Db2 database server on the system.

- Linux on Power LE does not support typical installation.
- The launchpad does not start in a Linux environment if you are using Firefox 45 or later. See
PortableApps.com Project on SourceForge to download portable
Firefox 44, or download an older version of Firefox from Mozilla's index
of Firefox releases.
