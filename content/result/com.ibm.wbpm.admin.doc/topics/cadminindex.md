# Administering the Workflow Center index

The Workflow Center index
is automatically created and maintained when the server is started.
After that, the system updates the index at regular intervals to reflect
any changes made to the repository. You can configure the update interval
and index location to better suit your installation. Also, commands
are provided for you to manually re-create or update the index.

- Manually re-creating or updating the Workflow Center index

You can manually re-create or update the Workflow Center index when the server is running.
- Configuring the Workflow Center index

You can configure the indexing process to automatically update the index on a preset schedule. You can also set the index location, and you can disable indexing altogether.
