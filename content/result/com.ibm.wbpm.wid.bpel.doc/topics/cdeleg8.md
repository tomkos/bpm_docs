# Ad hoc collaboration

Ad hoc tasks and transferred work items are created "on-the-fly"
in the runtime environment, usually because of new circumstances that
did not exist when the task was initially developed. Such tasks can
be used when the application is stand-alone, and when the task is
either to-do or collaboration.

- Subtasks

Subtasks support people when they need to delegate parts of their assigned work to other people, but want to keep control over the overall result. They can also be used to invoke supporting services to help people accomplish the tasks that they are working on.
- Follow-on tasks

Follow-on tasks support people when they want to delegate parts of their assigned work to other people, and the control over the completion of the work.
