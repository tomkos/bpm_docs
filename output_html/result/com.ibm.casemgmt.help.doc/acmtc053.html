<h1>Cannot cancel the check-out of documents in Case Client that</h1>

<p>were added from an Alfresco CMIS repository</p>

<p>However, if the case folder contains external documents, the Cancel check out action is disabled
for the documents from the Alfresco CMIS repository
after you perform a Checkout action. Thus, you cannot cancel the check-out of the documents in
Case Client.</p>

<p>To work around this issue, browse to the documents in the Alfresco CMIS repository and cancel the check-out.</p>
