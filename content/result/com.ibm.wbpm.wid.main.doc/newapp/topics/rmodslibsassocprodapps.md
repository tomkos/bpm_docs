# Modules and libraries associated with process applications
or toolkits

You do not need to version modules and libraries associated
with process applications or toolkits.

Modules and libraries that are associated with a process
application or toolkit do not need to be versioned. In fact, you cannot
create a version of a module or library associated with a process
application or toolkit in the dependency editor. Modules and libraries
associated with a process application or toolkit use snapshots, a
function in the Workflow Center,
to achieve the same result as a version.

Libraries associated
with a process application or toolkit will not have a required version
number in the Libraries section of the dependency editor because no
version is needed.
