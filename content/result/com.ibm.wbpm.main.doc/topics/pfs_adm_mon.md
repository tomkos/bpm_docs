# Monitoring and administering Process Federation Server

- Maintaining and operating federated systems

Federated environments consist of Process Federation Server and multiple federated systems. Use properties in the Process Federation Server server.xml configuration file to configure a business process management system for the federated environment and configure and maintain the indexing service for the system.
- Monitoring Process Federation Server instances using the Runtimedata REST API

Process Federation Server Runtimedata REST API provides insights into Process Federation Server instances through a hierarchical JSON view of their configuration augmented with runtime data and key performance indicators (KPI) that can be used to monitor a federated environment.
- Monitoring and administering with MBeans

You can monitor and administer a running server through its JMX MBeans to gather information, detect issues, and perform actions without having to restart the server.
