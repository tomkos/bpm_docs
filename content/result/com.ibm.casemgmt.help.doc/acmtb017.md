# Cannot view values when you edit cells in table-based rules

## Symptoms

When
you click in a cell of a table-based business rule, you cannot see
the values as you type or edit them until you press Enter.

## Causes

## Resolving the problem

To
work around this problem, try to expand the cell so that you can view
the entire typing area. Alternatively, you can edit the value by right-clicking
a cell and clicking Edit Custom Value.
