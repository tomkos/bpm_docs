# Finding failed events

One method of finding failed events is to click Get all failed events on
the failed event manager main page; this action returns a list of all Service Component Architecture
(SCA) and Javaâ„¢ Message Service (JMS) failed events on the
server. If Business Process Choreographer is installed, the query also returns failed, terminated,
and stopped Business Process Choreographer events. You can use this search option when you have only
a few failed events on the system, or when it is not necessary or possible to narrow the search
results by criteria.

## Finding business process instances or Common Base Events related to a failed event

If a failed event is generated from a business process, the failed event manager provides a link
to view that business process instance in Business Process Choreographer Explorer. In addition, a
failed event can be related to one or more Common Base Events; in this case, the failed event
manager has a link to those related events. A common session ID links the failed event with related
business process instances or Common Base Events. Examining these related process instances or
events can give you additional information about how or why the event failed.
