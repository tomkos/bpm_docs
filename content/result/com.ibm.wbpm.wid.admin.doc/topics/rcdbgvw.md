# Debug view in the integration debugger

The Debug view is shown in the following figure:

The component-related entities shown in the figure are described
in the following table:

|    Entity |  Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|        1  | A component thread, which consists of the thread ID and the thread status. In the Debug view figure, the thread ID is 46855 and the thread status is:Suspended at <mainProcess.bpel ( Suspended at Receive ) >) A component thread is identified by one of the following symbols: The suspended thread symbol  The running thread symbol   The terminated thread symbol                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|         2 | A stack frame, which consists of the component name and the stack frame information. A stack frame is a location indicator that shows you where the component thread is currently paused. For example, in the figure of the Debug view, the stack frame identifies the business process name mainProcess.bpel and the stack frame information (Suspended at Receive). Stack frames are identified by one of the following symbols: The business process stack frame symbol  The business state machine stack frame symbol  The business object data map stack frame symbol  The business rules stack frame symbol  The visual snippet stack frame symbol  The mediation flow stack frame symbol |
