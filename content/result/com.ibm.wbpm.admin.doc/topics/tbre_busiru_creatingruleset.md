# Creating rule set entries

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Click Copy next to the scheduled rule logic entry for the selected rule
set.

The edit page opens for the new entry, with a title Edit
Mode:Copy\_of\_TableName-Ruleset.
2. In the Name field enter a unique name for the new rule set entry.
3. In the Display Name field enter a display name for the new rule set
entry.
The display name does not need to be unique for the rule set. It can be any string value and
can contain special characters. If you do not specify a display name, the
Name value will be used for the display name.
Note: To synchronize the display name with the corresponding name of the rule set,
select the Synchronize with the name check box.
4. In the Description field enter a short description for the new rule set
entry.
5. Modify the values in each condition.

Tip: To display the parameter settings for each value, place your cursor over a field. A
rollover message shows the type of variable and its range.
6. Click the up or down arrow to place the rule in the correct sequence.
7. Click Save.

## Results

A message displays in the Messages field indicating that the rule set
entry has been temporarily saved and that you can publish the changes from the Publish and Revert
page.
