# Managing integration solutions in source control

## Before you begin

## About this task

Integration Designer provides
integration solutions, which are non-deployable projects that allow
you to logically reference related modules in a workspace. You can
add SCA modules, mediation modules, libraries, and Javaâ„¢ projects to a solution. The integration
solution diagram shows the invocations and relationships that exist
among the modules. Additionally, there are a few options in integration
solutions that allow you to streamline some team development tasks.

## Procedure

1 To add projects to the integration solution:
    1. Right-click Project References and
select Add or Remove Project References.
    2. In the Add or Remove Project References window,
select the modules that you want managed in the software configuration
management system. Click OK to save the changes.
2. To check out an integration solution from source control,
right-click Project References and select Check
Out Referenced Shared Projects.
