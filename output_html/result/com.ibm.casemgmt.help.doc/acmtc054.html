<h1>Inconsistent user interface behavior with bidirectional locales in IBM Business Automation</h1>

<p>Workflow</p>

<p>IBM Business Automation
Workflow supports basic right-to-left and left-to-right
language content, but it does not support more complicated bidirectional text.</p>

<p>IBM Business Automation
Workflow does not support non-Gregorian calendar controls or
date time formatting.</p>

<p>Because Case Client is a plug-in of IBM Content
Navigator, any bidirectional text, calendar, or date time issues for
IBM Content
Navigator can also apply for IBM Business Automation
Workflow.</p>
