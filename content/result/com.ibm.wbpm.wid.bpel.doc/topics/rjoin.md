# Join Behavior tab: BPEL process editor

- Yes
- When used on the process as a whole, this setting suppresses
the joinFailure fault for all activities in the process,
skips the activities that throw the fault, and continues with the
running of the process. When used on an individual activity, it overrides
the setting at the process level.

- No
- Use this setting to stop the process if the activity encounters
a fault in one of the incoming links.
