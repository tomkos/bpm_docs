# Business object editor

The business object editor works with the following views:

- Business Integration view
- Physical Resources view
- Editor area
- Properties view

## Business integration view

By
default, the resources are sorted by type of object. You can also
sort all of the resources within each module or library by the folders
that contain the resources or by namespaces (which would turn on and
display the namespaces of all the resources). The sort options can
be selected from the down arrow at the top of the Business Integration
view. You can also drag resources from the Business Integration
view to the canvas of the business object editor to further work with
them.

## Physical Resources view

The logical contents of the physical
file are also displayed in this view. For example, if you have several
business objects in an XSD file, you can expand the XSD file in this
view and see all the business objects in the file.

If you have
an artifact open in an editor, you can click the opened artifact in
the editor area (to focus on it) and then click the Link
open editors with content in the Navigator button  to quickly locate the file in
the Business Integration view.

## Editor area

When you open a business
object in the editor area, you can compose its contents. You can add
fields to the business object by clicking on the Add a
field to a business object icon .

Graphical editors work with the Properties view to
show the properties of selected elements on the canvas.

## Properties view

When
you use the Properties view with editors, you can modify properties
of selected elements in the editor.
