# Developing BPEL processes with Integration Designer

The BPEL process editor provides a graphical interface to your
BPEL processes and builds upon the existing functionality of the language.
You use this tool to visually create and manipulate BPEL processes.

- Key concepts for BPEL business processes 

A business process is any course of action or procedure that an organization follows to
achieve a larger business goal. When you break it down, a business process is actually a series of
individual tasks or activities that are performed in a specific order.
- Creating a BPEL process 

You can use the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) process editor to create a
BPEL process.
- Defining BPEL process logic 

Once you have created a BPEL process and defined its interfaces, you will need to define
its internal logic.
- Creating or importing data maps

Data maps assign values from one business object to another. Two types of data map are
supported: XML maps and business object maps. XML maps are the preferred choice.
- Defining events to be monitored 

There are several kinds of events in the BPEL process editor and in the corresponding
runtime environment.
- Versioning BPEL processes 

You can create new versions of your BPEL process, so that multiple versions of those same
processes can coexist in a runtime environment.
- Correlating BPEL processes 

Correlations are used in runtime environments where there are multiple instances of the
same process running. The sets allow two partners to initialize a BPEL process transaction,
temporarily suspend activity, and then recognize each other again when that transaction
resumes.
- Deploying a BPEL process

When it is time to deploy your BPEL process to a runtime environment, these topics
provide guidance.
- Launching Business Process Choreographer Explorer

Business Process Choreographer Explorer is a web client that communicates with a user in
a runtime environment.
- Dealing with application publication errors

When trying to publish an application that contains a business process, you might receive
an error.
- Building human tasks

To create and manipulate tasks that will be assigned to human staff members in the
runtime environment, use the human task editor.
- Creating business rules

To create and work with business rules, use the business rules editors.
- Working with business calendars

Business calendars are used to model noncontiguous time intervals (intervals that do not
proceed in a sequential manner). They provide a means of further defining time and schedule-based
operations or decisions. In IBM Integration Designer, business calendars can be created or edited
using the business calendar editor.
- Building business state machines

To create and work with business state machines, use the Business State Machine
editor.
