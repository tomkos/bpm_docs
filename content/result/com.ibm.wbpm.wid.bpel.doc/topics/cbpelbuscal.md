# Business calendars and BPEL processes

After selecting the business calendar to use in the BPEL process,
you can also enter a duration after which the activity needs to timeout.
The Business Process Choreographer runtime schedules these tasks with
the WebSphere Application Server scheduler which uses the selected
business calendar to determine when the duration has elapsed.

For more information on using a business calendar in a BPEL process,
