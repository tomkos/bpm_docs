<h1>Deployment of rules fails during solution deployment in IBM Business Automation</h1>

<p>Workflow</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>When you deploy your case management solution in Business Automation Workflow, you might see an error
similar to the following error: [6/22/18 12:37:14:086 CST] 000001c5 api E

converting following rule definition(s): CustomerRatingTable at
com.ibm.casemgmt.intgimpl.deploy.handlers.ContinuableStepException.createContinuableStepException(ContinuableStepException.java:35)</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<p>The ODMMessages.jar file, required for the embedded IBM Operational Decision
Manager rules SDK, is missing from the Content Platform Engine directory.</p>

<h2>Resolving the problem</h2>

<p>Complete the following steps to copy the required file on your system before you reattempt
solution deployment:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copy the ODMMessages.jar file from the Business Automation Workflow home directory
/opt/ibm/Workflow/v18.0/lib/ext to the external Content Platform Engine directory at
<WAS-home>/lib/ext.</li>
<li>Restart the external Content Platform Engine.</li>
</ol>
