# Configuring your network topology

- Customizing Business Automation Workflow to work with a web server

After you install and configure Business Automation Workflow, you must customize your environment so that it can function properly as a cluster with a web server.
- Customizing context roots for the components in a deployment environment

After you create a deployment environment, you can customize the context root for all components in the environment by using the BPMConfig script to add a prefix. You can also customize the Heritage Process Portal context root by adding a prefix that is specific to this component only.
- Configuring a proxy server

You can use the configureProxyServer.py script to create the routing server functionality for the Workflow Center cluster or the Workflow Server clusters when you have more than one node in your topology.
- Configuring the Business Space Ajax proxy

You might want to modify the Business Space Ajax proxy for special considerations in Heritage Process Portal (deprecated), such as changing timeout settings or blocking IP addresses for secure production environments.
