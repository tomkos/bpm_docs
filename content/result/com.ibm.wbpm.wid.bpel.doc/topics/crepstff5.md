# Replacement variables for escalation duration expressions

This variable that is referenced must contain a time specification
that is valid when the escalation is evaluated (if there are repeated
escalations, then this is the time at which the escalation is evaluated
the first time), and the variable must exist at the escalation's creation
time (otherwise you will get an error and the transaction will be
rolled back).

- Using percent signs within variable names is not allowed.
- If you want to use a percent sign in a string within the replacement
variable, then you will need to use two percent signs ("%%") instead
of one.
- Variables can contain XPath expressions. If an XPath expression
contains a "%" sign, it must be escaped as specified by XML (using &#37;).

1. Add a variable to your project that contains a string that will
be passed to the human task in the input message, and one that will
contain a valid time specification at run time.
2. Select the escalation object and go to the Details tab
in the Properties view.
3. As the duration, enter %htm:input.\yourVariableName%,
for example, %htm:input.\myEscalationTime%.
