# Importing artifacts from an IBM WebSphere Service Registry
and Repository

The IBM WebSphere Service Registry and Repository is a service metadata repository. With respect to IBM Integration
Designer, service metadata is used during the model and assembly stages of the service oriented architecture lifecycle. Service metadata is used to locate services to reuse and assess the impact of changes to service configurations. The services found in the IBM WebSphere Service Registry
and Repository cover a broad spectrum of artifacts. These artifacts
include WSDL interfaces with or without bindings and business objects.

The IBM WebSphere Service Registry and Repository
is a central point for finding and managing service metadata acquired
from a variety of sources. Service metadata from around an enterprise
is brought together to provide single descriptions of services. Services
can then be controlled, versioned, proposed changes analyzed and usage
monitored.

In this section, you are shown how to set up your preferences to
connect to a specific registry and then how to use the external service
discovery wizard to discover and import artifacts from the registry.
