# Working with micropatterns

For example, you might have a subprocess that consists of a service
call that is preceded by an assign activity that prepares that data
that is to be passed to the service call. The service call is followed
by another assign activity that maps the service data back to process
that data. You might also have an activity that validates the data
returned by the service call.

You can create this entire process as a micropattern that you can
use in other BPEL processes.

- Creating a micropattern

If you have a recurring need for a function, you can use a micropattern to create a reusable subprocess from a main Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) process
- Applying a micropattern

If you have a recurring need for a function, you can apply an existing micropattern from one Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) process to another.
- Customizable micropattern target properties

You can use a micropattern to create a reusable subprocess from a main process. When you work with micropatterns, you can customize many target properties.
- Limitations and restrictions

When you work with micropatterns, there are some limitations and restrictions you need to be aware of.
