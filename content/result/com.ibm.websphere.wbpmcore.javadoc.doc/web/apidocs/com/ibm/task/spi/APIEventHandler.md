## Class APIEventHandler

- java.lang.Object
    - com.ibm.task.spi.APIEventHandler

- All Implemented Interfaces:
APIEventHandlerPlugin, APIEventHandlerPlugin2, APIEventHandlerPlugin3, APIEventHandlerPlugin4, APIEventHandlerPlugin5, APIEventHandlerPlugin6

public class APIEventHandler
extends java.lang.Object
implements APIEventHandlerPlugin6
This class provides a default implementation for the Human Task Manager
 APIEventHandlerPlugin
 interfaces.
 
 Note that it is best practice to inherit from this class instead of implementing
 the interfaces directly. This helps to ensure upward compatibility of your code.
