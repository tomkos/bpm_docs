parameters (such as namespace and location) of your process migration
specification. The Process Migration Specification editor defines:

## Defining general settings

The Process Migration
Specification editor overview page defines the general settings of
your migration specification and the migration source and target.

in the Name field.

The differences page shows
the unique changes between the migration source and the migration
target. The difference page is read-only
