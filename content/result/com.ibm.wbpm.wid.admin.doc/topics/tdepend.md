## Procedure

1. In the Business Integration view, expand your component
test project and double-click Dependencies. The dependency
editor opens. Note that if the component test project is being used
to test a module that has a dependency on an SCA library, the SCA
library will be displayed in the Libraries section
of the dependency editor.
2 If you want to add a Java library as a dependency of thecomponent test project (perhaps because the library contains additionaltesting capabilities), complete the following steps:
    1. In the dependency editor, expand the Java section.
    2. In the Java section, click the Add button.
The Java Project Selection window opens.
    3. In the Select a project field,
type the name of the Java library or select it in the Java project
list.
    4. Click OK. The Java library is
displayed in the Java project list of the dependency editor.
3. Press Ctrl-S to save your changes
and close the editor.
