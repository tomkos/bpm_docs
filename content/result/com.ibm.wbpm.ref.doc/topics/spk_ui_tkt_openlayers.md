# OpenLayers API

## API key

For some map services, you must specify the API key so that the service can authenticate the
requester. Enter the API key that is appropriate for the map service you use. For example, Bing Maps
requires a Bing API key, but OpenStreet Maps does not need a key.

The OpenLayers API view is also used in association with the Geo coder and Geo location views.
For more information, see Geo coder and Geo location.

## Events
