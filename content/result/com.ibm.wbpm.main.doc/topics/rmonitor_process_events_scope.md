## Scope activity events

The
following table describes all scope activity events.

|   Code | Event name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  42020 | SCOPE\_STARTED             | Scope started. This event is emitted when the navigation enters the scope instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  42021 | SCOPE\_SKIPPED             | Scope skipped. The event applies only to scope activities that have join behavior defined. The event is emitted when the join condition of the scope evaluates to false. The navigation of the process continues at the end of the scope with dead-path elimination. Draft comment:  what does dead-path elimination apply to - the navigation or the scope? |
|  42022 | SCOPE\_FAILED              | Scope failed. This event is emitted when the process navigation leaves the fault handler of the scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  42023 | SCOPE\_FAILING             | Scope failing. This event is emitted when the process navigation enters the fault handling path of the scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  42024 | SCOPE\_TERMINATED          | Scope terminated. A scope activity can be terminated if the associated process is terminated, for example, by a terminate activity in a branch that is parallel to the scope activity.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  42026 | SCOPE\_COMPLETED           | Scope completed. This event is emitted when the normal navigation path of the scope and all of the activated event handler paths are completed.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  42043 | SCOPE\_COMPENSATING        | Scope compensating. This event is emitted when the process navigation enters the compensation handler, including the default compensation handler, of the scope.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  42044 | SCOPE\_COMPENSATED         | Scope compensated. This event is emitted when the compensation handler, including default compensation handler, of the scope completes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  42045 | SCOPE\_COMPENSATION\_FAILED | Scope compensation failed. This event is emitted if a fault occurs when the compensation handler for the scope runs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  42048 | SCOPE\_EVENT\_RECEIVED      | This event is emitted when a new event handler instance is started for the scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  42051 | SCOPE\_EVENT\_ESCALATED     | Scope event escalated. This event is emitted when the escalation is started that is associated with the inline human task of an active event handler for the scope.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  42066 | SCOPE\_STOPPED             | Scope is stopped. A scope instance can stop if an unhandled fault occurs during the activation or the follow-on navigation of a scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  42067 | SCOPE\_FORCE\_COMPLETED     | Scope is force completed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|  42076 | SCOPE\_CONDITION\_FORCED    | An activity that has stopped because of an error evaluating a join condition was forced to continue navigating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
