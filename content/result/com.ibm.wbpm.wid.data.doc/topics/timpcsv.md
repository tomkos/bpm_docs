# Importing relationship instance data from the comma-separated
values (CSV) format

## About this task

## Procedure

1. From the File menu, select Import > Business Integration > Relationship instance data and
click Next (Note that you can also import a
.csv file from the Properties page of a relationship using the Import button).
2. The Import Relationship Instance Data window opens. Use Browse to
select the .csv file and then identify the target relationship.
3. Click Next to select the role and
key attributes for each data column and to specify which rows to import.
In some cases, the CSV data contains the title rows for the columns,
which are not valid instance data values. You can clear the rows by
clicking the check box on the left side in each row. Note that every
role must be bound to a column, however, not all columns are required
to be bound.
4. Click Finish. After the data has
been imported, the target relationship will open in the relationship
editor.
