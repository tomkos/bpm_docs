# Displaying transaction paths in integration solutions

In the integration solution editor, you can display and
highlight the transaction path between components in a single module
or between the components in all of the modules that comprise your
integration solution. You can also display and highlight the transaction
path from a specific component to the other components with which
it interacts. If you choose, you can remove the highlighting from
the transaction path.

## About this task

## Procedure

1 In the integration solution editor, complete one of thefollowing steps:
    - If you want to display the transaction path between components
in a single module, right-click the module and select Show
Transaction in Module. The module is expanded to reveal
its components and the transaction path between the components is
highlighted in green.
    - If you want to display the transaction path between components
in all of the modules of the integration solution, right-click the
canvas or an empty area in the integration solution and select Show
Transaction in Solution. All of the modules are expanded
to reveal their components and the transaction path between the components
is highlighted in green.
    - If you want to display the transaction path between a specific
component and the components with which it interacts, right-click
the component and select Show Transaction from Here.
Note, however, that this menu item is not available if the transaction
path is already highlighted in the module where the component resides.
If the path is already highlighted, you can remove the highlighting
by following the instructions in the next step.
2. If you want to remove the highlighting from the transaction
path, right-click any area inside the integration solution editor
and select Remove Transaction Highlighting.
The transaction path is no longer highlighted in green.
