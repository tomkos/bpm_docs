# Connections from desktop Process Designer to
Workflow Center
(deprecated)

## Behavior

Components of desktop Process Designer use
multiple endpoints in communicating with Workflow Center. The initial connection is defined in the
Process Designer
eclipse.ini file as the value of the
com.ibm.bpm.processcenter.url system property. The property value is set during
Process Designer  configuration based on the value of
the EXTERNAL endpoint for bpmrepo-services.war that is configured on the
Workflow Center.

If the endpoint configuration of the bpmrepo-services.war file has changed,
desktop Process Designer must be downloaded from the
Workflow Center using a browser that is running on
the machine where the Process Designer will be
installed. Installing an interim fix also requires Process Designer to be downloaded and installed again.
Developers should never update the connection information in the Process Designer
eclipse.ini file.

Other endpoints used by desktop Process Designer
are not assumed to be relative to com.ibm.bpm.processcenter.url in the
eclipse.ini file. If the configuration of any of these other endpoints is
changed on Workflow Center, reinstallation of
Process Designer is not required. Simply restarting
Process Designer is sufficient because the URLs of
these endpoints are transferred from Workflow Center
to Process Designer with other configuration settings
at the beginning of every Process Designer bootstrap
operation (as a response from an EJB call).

## Settings

The Business Automation Workflow settings related to desktop Process Designer are transferred through the network
from Workflow Center to Process Designer as properties of the
AuthoringEnvironmentConfig configuration object every time Process Designer is launched. These properties affect the
connections created between Process Designer and
Workflow Center. The following list contains
properties that affect the connections and explains how to set the properties.

The AuthoringEnvironmentConfig object
contains the following properties:

| Name                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Additional Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Suppress Redirect URL Password      | Specifies whether to suppress the inclusion of the user password in the URLs that Process Designer opens. For example, each time you run a playback in Process Designer, a new Process Portal browser session is opened. Process Designer then submits the user credentials, which consist of the user ID and password, and the browser session uses these credentials to log in. The suppressRedirectUrlPasswd option stops the password from being included in the URL to improve security. Note: When you use the suppressRedirectUrlPasswd option, you only need to log into the browser the first time that you open a web editable artifact or run a playback in Process Designer. This option only applies to Process Designer and can be turned on and off as needed.                                                                                             | Information on setting the 									suppressRedirectUrlPasswd attribute is 								found in the topic Installing IBM Process Designer.                                                                                                                          |

| Deploy Snapshot Using HTTPS         | Specifies whether the Workflow Center Server uses HTTPS to deploy process applications and toolkits to Workflow Servers. If the property is set to the default value of true and all Workflow Servers are secure, then communication from Workflow Center to Workflow Server will work with HTTP Secure (HTTPS) or HTTP over SSL. However, if you have a mix of secure and non-secure servers, Workflow Center can only communicate with Workflow Servers that are configured to work with this mixed configuration.<authoring-environment merge="mergeChildren"> 	<deploy-snapshot-using-https merge="replace">true 	</deploy-snapshot-using-https> </authoring-environment>                                                                                                                                                                                             | These properties are all 								configured using Business Automation Workflow configuration XML files.

| Encode Redirect URL Credentials     | Specifies whether the credentials that are passed in a URL that implements redirect-login.jsp are encoded. For example, you can encode credentials in a URL that is used to start a service directly from Process Designer. By default, this property is set to true, which specifies that the credentials passed in a Business Automation Workflow URL are encoded. If you change the setting to false, the URL is composed with credentials in plain text.<authoring-environment merge="mergeChildren"> 	<encode-redirect-url-credentials merge="replace">true 	</encode-redirect-url-credentials> </authoring-environment>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | These properties are all 								configured using Business Automation Workflow configuration XML files.

## Ports

| Port Name             | Cluster             | Communication protocol   |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| WC\_defaulthost        | Application cluster | HTTP                     |
| WC\_defaulthost\_secure | Application cluster | HTTPS                    |

To determine the ports used by your Workflow Center environment, see the WebSphere® Application
Server administrative
console Ports collection page for the appropriate cluster member. Click Server Types > WebSphere application servers > server\_name > Communications > Ports.

## Troubleshooting

Trace support exists for logging the configuration object that is obtained and used by desktop Process Designer. You should increase
the-Djava.util.logging level to either the ALL or
CONFIG level as described in the topic Problems starting the desktop Process Designer. This
will cause the configuration values that are made available by Workflow Center to Process Designer to be written to the Eclipse
.log file. Search the log for the
AuthoringEnvironmentConfig string and examine the listed properties to
ensure that the values of the properties are correct.

For information about troubleshooting connections between desktop Process Designer and Workflow Center, see the topic Problems starting the desktop Process Designer.
