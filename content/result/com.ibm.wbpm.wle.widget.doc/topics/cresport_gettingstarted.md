# Starting Process Portal

## Getting started

```
https://[host\_name]:[port]/ProcessPortal
```

## Dashboards

The Process Portal
default start page is the Work dashboard, however, your administrator might
have specified a different start page for your environment. You can change your default start page
by changing the order of the entries in the Dashboards list in the navigation
pane: the first entry in the list is used as your default start page.

The Work dashboard contains your task list. It has a main menu where you
can start dashboards and saved searches from, a context menu that shows the process instances you
are following, and the posts that mention you. On mobile devices these menus might not be visible
when you start Process Portal, but you can display them by selecting the appropriate icons. Try task prioritization, which uses
machine learning to sort your userâ€™s task list according to skill and performance. For more information, see Installing, configuring, and administering Machine Learning Server.
