# Adding a link to a snippet

## About this task

## Procedure

1 Create a link automatically in either of these ways:
    1. Click an Input in the tray, and
drag it onto an input terminal of an existing activity on the canvas,
or
    2. Click an item in the palette, and then click a valid
input or output terminal of an existing activity on the canvas.
The crossed out circle on your cursor will disappear when the
terminal is a valid choice for a link.
2 Link two existing objects on the canvas as follows:

1. Drop an activity onto the canvas. If it can
take an incoming link, it will have a triangle on its left edge .
If it can take an outgoing link, the triangle will be on the right
edge .
2. Move the cursor over an outgoing link until the yellow
circle appears as shown in this image.
3. Click the yellow circle. The cursor will
change appearance, and will look like a plus sign with a crossed out
circle beside it.
4. Drag the cursor out over the canvas. A yellow
string is now attached to the cursor, and when you hover over a valid
incoming link icon, the crossed out circle disappears.
5. Click the activity that you want to link to. The
link becomes a solid gray line and connects the two activities.
6. To change the target activity, click the link so that
it becomes highlighted, click the black box at the target end of the
link, and drag it to a new incoming link.
