# Inconsistent user interface behavior with bidirectional locales in IBM Business Automation
Workflow

IBM Business Automation
Workflow supports basic right-to-left and left-to-right
language content, but it does not support more complicated bidirectional text.

IBM Business Automation
Workflow does not support non-Gregorian calendar controls or
date time formatting.

Because Case Client is a plug-in of IBM Content
Navigator, any bidirectional text, calendar, or date time issues for
IBM Content
Navigator can also apply for IBM Business Automation
Workflow.
