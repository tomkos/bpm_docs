# Publishing and reverting business rules

## Before you begin

## About this task

To publish the changes to a business rule group or rule schedule, perform the
following steps.

## Procedure

1. Click Publish and Revert.
2. On the Publish and Revert page, select the business rule groups and rule
schedules to send to the repository.
You can publish all the business rule groups and rule schedules together as a single
transaction, or just a subset of them.Note: To cancel all changes that have been saved locally to a
business rule group or rule schedule and replace the changed resource with the original copy in the
server memory, select the check box for the business rule group or rule schedule and click
Revert. Business rule groups and rule schedules cannot be reverted after
publishing since publishing changes the original copy that resides in the server
memory.
3. Click Publish.

The selected business rule groups and rule schedules are written to the server memory.
