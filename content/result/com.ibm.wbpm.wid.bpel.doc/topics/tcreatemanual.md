# Modelling business calendars manually

## About this task

## Procedure

1. From the business calendar editor, click Add
Interval or Exception.
2. Click Create an interval manually in
the Getting Started view on the right.
3. In the Details for the Selected Time Interval,
edit the fields as necessary to meet your requirements. For example,
you can change the name of the time interval to something more descriptive
and indicate the start and end times in the First occurrence fields.
4. Set the repetition to indicate when and how often you would
like the business calendar to run.
5. To add the unavailability period, click Add
Exception. From here you can either select an option from
the list of examples, or you can click Create interval
manually.
6. In the Details for the Selected Exception,
you can provide a descriptive name for the exception and edit the First
occurrence and repetitions fields as needed.
7. You should now see the exception listed in the calendar
details.
8. Save the business calendar. Note that it is now available
in the business integration view under the Business Logic container.

## What to do next

To see a schedule representation of the business calendar, click Schedule
Overview. The schedule will open in the Properties tab. From here you can view the
schedule on a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis. If you see a blank schedule or a Flash
information graphic, it is because the schedule won't display if Flash isn't installed. Flash is end
of life. For more information, see the Adobe Flash Player EOL General Information Page.
