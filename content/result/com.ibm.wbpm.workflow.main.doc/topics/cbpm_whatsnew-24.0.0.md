command has been enhanced to generate two files,
TeamworksConfiguration.running.xml and
TeamWorksConfiguration.system.xml for each server, and also at the cluster
level. The TeamWorksConfiguration.system.xml file contains only the default
configuration, so you can compare the two files and see what customizations have been made.

## Security and compliance for Business Automation Workflow on containers

When Business Automation Workflow
capabilities interact with each other, network traffic is encrypted by default. In earlier versions,
encryption used TLS 1.2. In 24.0.0.0, most internal communication now defaults to the more modern
and secure TLS 1.3 version. The same is true for outbound communication, for example to custom
databases or APIs that are used by customized applications.
