# Log on properties for a secure server

This service is created for you when you select the Generate
Web service for Cognos authentication option as shown
in Viewing and importing a Cognos report as a web service.
The service is shown in the following screen capture as LogonCognos.

Logging
on to a secure Cognos server requires using a hash map of values.
You would need to set these credentials in our example: namespace,
username and password. Your configuration could require other credentials.

You
can see the logon properties in a business process by selecting the
assign activity containing them and clicking the Details tab
in the Properties view.
