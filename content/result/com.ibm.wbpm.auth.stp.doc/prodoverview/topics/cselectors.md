# Selectors

Routing to a component is based on dates. For example: Two weeks
before school starts, offer a back-to-school special price on our
school-related merchandise.

Businesses might have many such routes based on dates. A selector
makes a decision to select one route over another at run time based
on a date. For example, if the time is just before school starts,
then the previous back-to-school offer would be called. However, if
it is the season when school is ending, there could be an offer to
prepare children for summer.
