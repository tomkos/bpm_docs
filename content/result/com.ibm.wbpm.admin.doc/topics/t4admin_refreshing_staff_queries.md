## About this task

Business
Process Choreographer caches the results of people queries, which
have been evaluated against a people directory, such as a Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server, in the runtime database.
If the people directory changes, you can force the people assignments
to be evaluated again.

## Procedure

then on the Configuration tab, in the Business Process Manager section, expand Business Process Choreographer, and click Human Task Manager.
2. On the Runtime tab, click Refresh People Queries. All people queries
are refreshed.
