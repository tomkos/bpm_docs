# Stand-alone references

Services that are not defined as SCA components (for example, JavaServer
Pages) can still invoke SCA components; they do so through the use
of stand-alone references. Stand-alone references contain partner
references that identify the components to call. On their own, stand-alone
references do not have any implementation or interface.
