## About this task

## Procedure

that contains the binding by navigating to Applications > SCA Modules and clicking the
module name.

and then expand Binding.
    3 Click the binding to be administered. The general properties of the binding are displayed: Note: You can also access a resource by typing the JNDI name in the text box. Doing so,however, allows you to enter the name of a resource that is not yet configured.

Destination.

the Listener Port, and the Activation Specification.

Configure option at Listener Port displays a page showing all
listener ports with the cluster Listener Port names for all the members of the given cluster; you
can then select one listener port.When Configure has been selected, the
corresponding WebSphereÂ® Application
Server
page will open.
