# Defaults tab: BPEL process editor

## Process level

- Javaâ„¢
- This is the default setting for processes that use BPEL extensions,
otherwise XPath 1.0 will be the default . If you choose this, then
you will be able to compose the expressions in the Java programming language using either the visual
snippet editor, or a text editor.

- Choose this to always have a user interface prompt you for your
expression choices. For example, when you are required to compose
a condition, you will be able to work with the appropriate fields
and drop down menus.

- XPath 1.0
- Choose this to compose the expressions in the XPath 1.0 programming
language, using either the XPath Expression Builder, or a text editor.
