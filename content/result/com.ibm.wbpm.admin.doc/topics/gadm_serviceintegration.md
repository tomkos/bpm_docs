# Managing service integration in applications

A service integration bus is a form of managed communication that supports service integration
through synchronous and asynchronous messaging. A bus consists of interconnecting messaging engines
that manage bus resources. The members of a service integration bus are the application servers and
clusters on which the messaging engines are defined.
