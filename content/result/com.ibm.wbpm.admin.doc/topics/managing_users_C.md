# Creating and maintaining users for a stand-alone server

## Before you begin

- To create and maintain users, log in as an administrative user,
such as a user in the DeAdmin role. Do not remove the user or group
assigned to the DeAdmin role. Only users and groups assigned to this
role can administer servers and users.
- To create users, you must have permission at the WebSphere Application
Server level.

## About this task

- The default user registry is the WebSphereÂ® Application
Server file registry.
- When you add an administrative user during installation, the new
user is automatically added to the tw\_admins user
group. Users in the tw\_admins group can administer
workflow servers, Performance Data Warehouses, and internal users and
groups.
