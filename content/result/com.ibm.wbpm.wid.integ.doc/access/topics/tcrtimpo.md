# Creating imports

## About this task

- Drag an export from another module and drop it into the assembly
diagram. When prompted, select the import with the required binding.
- Select Import from the palette and drop
it into the assembly diagram.
- Drag an interface from the same module or a dependent library
and drop it into the assembly diagram. When prompted, select the Import
with No Binding or Import with Web Service
Binding. To use interfaces from a library, open the module
with the dependency editor and add a dependency on the library. You
will be prompted if the dependency has to be set. For bindings information,
see the topics under related tasks.
- If you are doing top-down development and have not yet generated
an implementation, you can also convert a component into an import
using the Convert to import action from the
component's menu.
- To create an import that uses an adapter, from the Outbound Adapters
folder on the assembly editor palette, select an adapter and drag
it onto the canvas. Complete the fields in the wizard to generate
the import.
