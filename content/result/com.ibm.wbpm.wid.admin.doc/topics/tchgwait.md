# Selecting asynchronous invocations for Wait On steps

## About this task

## Procedure

1. In the test suite editor, click the Test Cases tab
to open the Test Cases page.
2. In the Test Cases area, select the
Wait On step for which you want to select an asynchronous invocation
to wait on.
3. In the Wait On field of the Detailed
Properties area, select the asynchronous invocation that you want
the Wait On step to wait on. In the Test Cases area, the Wait On step
displays the name of the asynchronous invocation that it is waiting
on. Note that test cases and invocations are run sequentially from
top to bottom in the Test Cases area, which means that a Wait On step
must appear immediately below the asynchronous invocation that it
is waiting on.
4. If you want to open the detailed properties for the asynchronous
invocation that you have selected, you can click the Wait
On link.
