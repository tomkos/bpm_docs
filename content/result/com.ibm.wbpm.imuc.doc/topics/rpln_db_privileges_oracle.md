# Oracle database privileges

When you create database schemas using the typical installation
or database scripts that are generated using the BPMConfig command-line
utility, your user ID must have the authority to create tables. When
the tables are created, you must have the authority to select, insert,
update, and delete information in the tables.

- The connect privilege
- Quota (preferably unlimited) on the table spaces of tables the user owns
- Every BPM user must have the ability to recover XA transactions. If required, the underlyingapplication server infrastructure triggers XA recovery automatically, which requires the followingprivileges. If you do not want to assign these XA privileges to the regular users, you can specifyan XA authentication alias at the data source level and assign the XA privileges to the dedicated user:
    - Select on pending\_trans$
    - Select on dba\_2pc\_pending
    - Select on dba\_pending\_transactions
    - Execute on dbms\_xa

| The user ID needs sufficient privilege to create relational tables and indexes in the data store schema. The database also needs a space quota in the default table space of the owner of that schema. | The user ID needs the SESSION privilege to connect to the database. If the same user ID owns both the data store schema and the component that is connecting to the database, the user ID has sufficient privilege to manipulate the tables. Otherwise, the user ID needs SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, ALTER, and DELETE object privileges on the tables that make up the data store, and the DROP ANY TABLE system privilege to enable the use of the TRUNCATE TABLE statement. The user ID also requires the CREATE INDEX privilege.See the following table for detailed Oracle database privileges for IBM Business Automation Workflow and WebSphereÂ® Enterprise Service Bus components. |
