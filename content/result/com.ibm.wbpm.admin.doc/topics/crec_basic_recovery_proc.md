# Recovery: Analyzing the problem

There are six well defined steps to situational analysis:

1. Define the question
2. Gather information and resources (observe)
3. Form hypothesis
4. Perform experiment and collect data
5. Analyze data
6. Interpret data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point
for new hypothesis

For each production scenario the symptoms that initiate a recovery
action may vary.

It is important to follow the guidelines for situational analysis
and take the corrective action relative to the symptoms that are presented.

Situational analysis is the cyclical execution of the scientific method and can take into account various situations that will initiate a recovery procedure.
