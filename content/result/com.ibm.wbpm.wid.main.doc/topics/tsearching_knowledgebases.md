# Searching knowledge bases (web search)

If you have a problem with your IBMÂ® software,
you want it resolved quickly. Knowledge bases can help you succeed.

## Before you begin

## About this task

Begin by searching the available knowledge bases to determine
whether the resolution to your problem is already documented. Launch
the IBM Support Assistant (ISA) to do the searching.

Assistant
