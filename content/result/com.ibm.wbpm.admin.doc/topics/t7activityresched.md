# Rescheduling activities

## Before you begin

To reschedule an activity, you must be a system
administrator or an administrator of the activity, an enclosing scope,
or the process. However,
if Business Flow Manager is using the alternative process administration
mode that restricts process administration to system administrators,
then only users in the BPESystemAdministrator role can perform this
action.

## About this task

To reschedule an activity, complete the following steps
in Business Process Choreographer Explorer.

## Procedure

1. In the Views tab,
navigate to the Activity Instance List page. Select the activity you
want to reschedule, and click Reschedule. Alternatively,
click the name of the activity you want to reschedule and, on the
Activity page, click Reschedule.
2. On the Reschedule Activity page, specify a date and time
to reschedule the activity. Alternatively, you can specify that the
activity is never rescheduled or that it is immediately rescheduled.
3. Then click OK.
