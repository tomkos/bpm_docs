## Receive activity, onEvent element, and receive case
element (within a receive choice activity)

<!-- image -->

Use
the settings on this page to configure the authorization settings
for either a receive activity, or a receive case element within a
receive choice activity. These authorization duties include identifying
those staff members that are allowed to send the request to the receive
or receive choice activity and are assigned to those staff members
in the form of a human task; this implies that these staff members
are allowed to start the process in case the receive or receive choice
activity starts a new process instance.

If
there is no existing human task associated, click New to launch
the human task editor to configure one. If there is a human task associated,
then click Open to launch the human task editor to make any
needed modifications to it, or click Remove to clear the association.
