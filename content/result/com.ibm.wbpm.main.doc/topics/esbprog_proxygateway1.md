Using the interface you can create, delete and amend virtual services associated with a proxy group.

Figure 1 shows the high level interactions of the proxy
gateway, the configuration store and the web based interface. The Built-in Configuration
Store maintains the associations between proxy groups and proxy gateways. The proxy gateways
contain definitions of virtual services and their defined endpoints. The browser window shows the
Business Space widget that is used to administer the proxy groups and their virtual service
definitions.
