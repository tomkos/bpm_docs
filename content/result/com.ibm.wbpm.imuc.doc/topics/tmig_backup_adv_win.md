# Backing up databases

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have shut down the source environment
before you proceed with the migration.

## Procedure

1. Verify that sufficient space exists to back
up your databases. The size that is required for the backups depends
on the size of your production databases and the specifics of your
database backup strategy.
2. Back up your existing IBM Business Process Manager
 databases,
using the backup utilities for your database software.
You must create a backup of all the databases that
your source environment was using.
