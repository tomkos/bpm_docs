# Managing test configurations

## About this task

- Adding test bucket configurations

In the integration test client, you can create one or more new test bucket configurations. A test bucket configuration is used to customize and control a component test, while a test configuration is used to control a unit test. You can edit and customize any existing test bucket configuration or you can add and customize new test bucket configurations for specific tests.
- Editing test bucket configurations

In the integration test client, you can edit the test bucket configuration and customize it for specific tests. For example, you can add test suites and test cases to the test bucket configuration.
- Adding test configurations to the integration test client

Although a default test configuration is automatically created whenever you start the integration test client, you can also create one or more new test configurations. This enables you to supplement existing test configurations with test configurations that are customized for specific tests.
- Editing test configurations

In the integration test client, you can edit any test configuration and customize it for specific tests. For example, you can add modules to a test configuration or add emulators or monitors to a module in a test configuration.
- Saving test configurations in the integration test client

In the Configurations page of the integration test client, you can save one or more open test configurations in a test configuration file. This enables you to save ready-made customized test configurations that you can later load into the integration test client to test your modules and components.
- Loading test configurations into the integration test client

When using the integration test client, you can load any test configurations that you earlier saved in a test configuration file. This enables you to load ready-made customized test configurations that you have saved rather than creating and customizing new test configurations.
- Removing test configurations from the integration test client

You can remove any unused test configurations that are open in the Configurations page of the integration test client. This enables you to more easily manage the remaining test configurations. If you save a test configuration before removing it, the test configuration will be available for you to later load back into the integration test client.
- Deleting test configuration files

You can delete one or more test configuration files that contain your saved test configurations. This enables you to more easily manage the remaining test configuration files for use with the integration test client.
