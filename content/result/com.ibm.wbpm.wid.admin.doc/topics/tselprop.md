# Selecting operations for testing

## Before you begin

To select
an operation for testing:

## Procedure

1. In the integration test client, click the Events tab
to open the Events page.
2. In the Configuration field, ensure
that the correct test configuration is selected. A default test configuration
is automatically created whenever you open the integration test client.
If you did not open the integration test client by loading a test
configuration that you saved earlier, the default test configuration
will already be selected in the Configuration field.
3. In the Module field, ensure that
the correct module is selected. If you opened the integration test
client by selecting a module, this module will already be selected
in the Module field.
4. In the Component field, ensure that
the component is selected that contains your interface operation.
5. In the Interface field, ensure that
the interface is selected that contains your operation.
6. In the Operation field, ensure that
the operation is selected that you want to test.
