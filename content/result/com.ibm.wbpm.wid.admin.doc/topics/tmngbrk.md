# Managing breakpoints in the integration debugger

## About this task

- Adding breakpoints in the integration debugger

When you are working with the integration debugger, you can add breakpoints directly on component elements in a component editor or in lines of code in the Java snippet editor or condition editor. Any breakpoint that is added in a component instance is also automatically added to all other instances of the component and you do not need to restart any of the instances.
- Disabling breakpoints in the integration debugger

When you are working with the integration debugger, you can disable breakpoints directly in component elements in a component editor or in lines of code in the Java snippet editor or condition editor.  You can also use the Breakpoints view to select and disable breakpoints. Any breakpoint that you disable in a component instance is also automatically disabled in all other instances of the component and you do not need to restart any of the instances.
- Enabling breakpoints in the integration debugger

When you are working with the integration debugger, you can enable breakpoints directly in component elements in a component editor or in lines of code in the Java snippet editor or condition editor.  You can also use the Breakpoints view to select and enable breakpoints. Any breakpoint that you enable in a component instance is also automatically enabled in all other instances of the component and you do not need to restart any of the instances.
- Removing breakpoints in the integration debugger

When you are working with the integration debugger, you can remove breakpoints directly from component elements in a component editor or from lines of code in the Java snippet editor or condition editor. You can also use the Breakpoints view to select and remove breakpoints. Any breakpoint that is removed from a component instance is also automatically removed from all other instances of the component and you do not need to restart any of the instances.
- Applying hit counts to breakpoints in the integration debugger

In the integration debugger, you can add hit counts to breakpoints that have been set in business processes. When a hit count is applied to a breakpoint, the breakpoint suspends execution of the process thread when the specified hit count value is encountered. The process thread execution remains suspended until it is enabled again or until the hit count is changed or disabled.
- Restricting breakpoints to specific process threads in the integration debugger

In the integration debugger, you can restrict a breakpoint to one or more threads of a business process. This enables you to work more easily with just those threads that you are currently interested in, rather than with all threads of the process.
