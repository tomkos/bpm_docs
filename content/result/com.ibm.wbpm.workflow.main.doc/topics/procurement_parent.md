# Procurement sample tutorial

The general tasks for building a process application like the one
shown in the Procurement tutorial are described in the topic Scenario: Developing a straight through process.

The Procurement tutorial starts with a BPEL process that was originally
created in IBMÂ® Integration
Designer.
The tutorial shows how to associate that process with a process application
and adapt it so it can be used in the Workflow Center.

The Procurement sample BPEL process application, which contains
the process you use in the tutorial, is preinstalled and is ready
to run without the need for any modeling or configuration on your
part. Before running this sample, you need to select an appropriate
snapshot of the process application and activate it.
