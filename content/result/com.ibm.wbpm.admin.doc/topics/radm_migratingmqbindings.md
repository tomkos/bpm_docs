# Migrating WebSphere MQ Bindings from version 6 to
later versions

Migration is only required for WebSphereÂ® MQ
bindings that contain pre-configured resources.

## Specifying an activation specification

In WebSphere ESB version 7, the WebSphere MQ binding uses the WebSphere MQ resource adapter to receive messages, which requires an activation specification.
If a WebSphere MQ binding has pre-configured WebSphere MQ resources, define an additional activation
specification JNDI name in the end-point configuration of the binding. This JNDI name must refer to
an existing activation specification JMS resource on the server.

## Modifying destination properties

You must add these custom properties in the pre-configured destinations:

| Destination Type    | Property Name   | Property Value   | Property Type    |
