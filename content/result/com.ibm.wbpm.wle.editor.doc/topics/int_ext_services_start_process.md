| Request headers | The header must be in the following JSON format {"Authorization":"Basic credentials"}Where credentials is a base64 encoded string that is constructed from userName:password.  If you are connecting to an on-prem workflow server use the appropriate username and password for your system. If you are connecting to a workflow server running in a cloud environment, the user name is a functional ID, and the password is a generated character string. You must make sure that the functional ID is granted access to the necessary operating environments.
