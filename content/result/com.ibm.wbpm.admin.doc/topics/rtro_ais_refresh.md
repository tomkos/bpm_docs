# AIS does not refresh automatically in the Inspector view

Even fast request and response services can seem to take
a long time the first time they are called and the service is initializing.

## Resolving the problem

If the process state
in the Inspector view does not seem to progress, click the Refresh
icon and wait for the Advanced Integration service call to complete
and the BPD to resume. Click the Refresh icon again if necessary.

If
the Advanced Integration service still does not complete, check with
its implementation owner. The service might be waiting for something,
such as a human task or an error to be fixed.
