# Setting preferences and notifications

Your user profile contains your personal contact information and preferences that you can
set for working with Process Portal and receiving
notifications.

## Setting preferences

- Contact information, including a photo. Your photo appears in your posts and comments.
- Portal preferences. These preferences include settings for your working language, receiving
confirmation messages when you claim a task, opening a task in a new window, and receiving
notifications by email.
- Notification preferences. By default, you receive a notification when an event occurs that
affects you, for example, a task is assigned to you, an activity is updated, or you are mentioned in
a post. Attention: Depending on how Process Portal is set up, your user
profile might not contain the notification preferences section.

### Procedure

1. In the main menu, click User Profile.
2. Make the changes to your settings and click Save.

### Results

## Setting notifications
