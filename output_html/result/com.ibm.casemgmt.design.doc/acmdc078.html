<h1>Solution application assets</h1>

<p>Examples of solution application assets include image objects, custom rules, custom
servlets, widgets, and reporting templates. When you migrate your solutions from one environment to
another, ensure that you migrate all of the solution application assets that are associated with
your solution.</p>

<p>If your solution is
translated, you must migrate the translated user interface in your
case management application by exporting the translated assets from
the source domain and deploying them in the target domain. For more
information, see Migrating the translated user interface elements of your case management application.</p>

<h2>Other FileNet P8 assets</h2>

<p>The
following assets are stored in Content Platform Engine or other components
that are managed by FileNet® P8 tools.</p>
