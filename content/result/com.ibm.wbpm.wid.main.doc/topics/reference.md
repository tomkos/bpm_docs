# Reference

Reference information supports the tasks you want to complete.
The information includes user interfaces and limitation topics.

- Mediation primitives
- Mediation primitives are the building blocks of mediation flows
and, generally, a mediation module contains one or more mediation
primitives. Mediation primitives let you change the format, content,
or target of service requests.

- Quality of service qualifier reference
- Qualifiers are specifications that define a set of communication
characteristics required by an application for transmission priority,
level of route reliability, transaction management, and security level.
You can specify quality of service (QoS) qualifiers in the assembly
editor. These qualifiers define how much management must be provided
for a component at run time.

- Limitations
- Restrictions and limitations in the product are described here.
