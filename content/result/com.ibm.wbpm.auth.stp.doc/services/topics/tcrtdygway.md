# Creating a dynamic service gateway

## About this task

This topic describes how to use the pattern to create
a service gateway. The pattern provides a starting point to create
common service gateway scenarios. You can also create a service gateway
by creating all the artifacts yourself. For more information, see Importing the ServiceGateway interface and schema

To create a dynamic service gateway from the
pattern, follow these instructions:
