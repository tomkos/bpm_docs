# Installing IBM Business Automation
Workflow on AIX or Linux using
a typical installation and configuration path

The typical installation option is the simplest and quickest method
for installing and configuring IBM Business Automation
Workflow.

- Linux on Power LE does not support typical installation.
- The launchpad does not start in a Linux or AIX environment if you are using Firefox 45 or later.
See PortableApps.com Project on SourceForge to download portable
Firefox 44, or download an older version of Firefox from Mozilla's index
of Firefox releases.
- IBM Business Automation
Workflow Enterprise Service Bus does not support
typical installation.

## About this task

From the product launchpad, the typical installation process installs the
software, configures the deployment manager and managed-node profiles, and configures a
single-cluster deployment environment that consists of one node and one server. It also installs IBM WebSphere SDK Java Technology Edition 8 (Java 8).
