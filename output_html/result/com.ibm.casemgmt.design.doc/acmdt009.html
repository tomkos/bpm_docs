<h1>Converting a solution into a template</h1>

<p>You can convert a solution into a template. You use templates to quickly create new
solutions that are based on the same design. The template contains all the solution design
information and assets, but you cannot edit the template directly or create running cases from it.</p>

<ul>
<li>You create a template from a snapshot of a base case solution.</li>
<li>You create a new case solution from a snapshot of a template. See Adding a solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Converting a case solution into a template</h2>
