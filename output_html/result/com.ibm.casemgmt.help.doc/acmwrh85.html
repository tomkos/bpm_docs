<h1>Form widget (deprecated)</h1>

<p>The Form widget incorporates forms that are
designed in a form application such as IBMÂ® Forms. To use the Form widget,
you must configure it to use a specific form template (or localization
proxy) or to use a form attachment (a form data document, form template,
or localization proxy). You can also edit the settings for the Form
widget to customize event handling for the widget.</p>

<p>You can configure more than one instance of this page to create a page for each step (work item)
of an activity. Or, you can use the same page for each step, depending on your requirements. If you
want to use a different configuration for each step in an activity, make copies of the appropriate
IBM Business Automation
Workflow page, and then configure a copy for
each step.</p>

<p>You can wire the Form widget to a custom widget so
that the custom widget can read and write property values. You can
also use the Form widget on a page that contains the Properties widget.</p>

<h2>IBM Business Automation</h2>

<p>Workflow pages that include this
widget by default</p>

<p>You can configure more than one instance of this
page to create a page for each role. For example, you can configure
a page for a case worker and another one with different fields for
a manager.</p>

<li>Configuring the Form widget to use a form template (deprecated)</li>
</ul>

<p>When you configure the Form widget to use a form template, workers can use the widget to create a case or to view and modify the property values for a case or step (work item). The data in the form is mapped to step parameters and case properties. A form data document is not saved.
- Configuring the Form widget to use a form attachment (deprecated)</p>

<p>When you configure the Form widget to use a form attachment, workers can use the widget in place of the Properties widget to view and edit the property values for a step (work item). When the worker completes or saves the step, a form data document is saved and attached to the step. You can configure the Form widget to use a form attachment only when you use the Form widget on the Form Attachment Work Details page in the Step Pages space.
- Form widget events (deprecated)</p>

<p>The Form widget publishes and handles events to display case and work item properties in a form for users to view and edit.</p>
