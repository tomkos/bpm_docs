# BPEL process

- Describe the orchestration of other services using control flow
graphs
- Use variables to keep the process state
- Use sophisticated error handling through fault handling
- Support asynchronous events
- Correlate inbound requests with the right instance of a particular
process
- Provide extended transactions through sophisticated compensation
support

The process editor uses visual representations of BPEL constructs
to build your business process quickly and simply.

A BPEL process cannot be used in a mediation module. It can be
deployed only to an IBMÂ® Workflow
Server.
