# Defining roles

## About this task

The following list provides more information on each of
the property pages:

The Synchronize with
the name check box is used to ensure that the Name value
and Display name values are identical. If the flag is true, then it
is only possible to change the Name field. The Display name value
follows the changes in the Name field. Note that the synchronize flag
is not stored  in the .rel file. This means, that each time you open
the relationship editor, the initial flag status is calculated by
the editor itself.  The rule is that if the values of Name and Display
name are identical on the load time of the editor, then the flag is
set to true. If the values are different, then
the flag is set to off.

If the role
is internal, which means that it is defined within the relationship
definition, only the Name and Display name can be edited. Additionally,
the appearance of the role differs in the canvas. The internal role
does not display the location information as it is in the same location
as the relationship.

You can add
a new property by clicking the Add button.
The Add Property window opens. In this window, enter the name of the
property, selected a type from the drop-down box, and enter a value
for the property (optional).
