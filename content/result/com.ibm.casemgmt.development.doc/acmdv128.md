# PUT method for the particular activity instance resource

To avoid unnecessary Content Platform Engine errors, the
PUT method ensures that the activity is in the correct state before the activity
is updated. If a case worker requests to disable an activity, the PUT method
ensures that the activity is not in a working or complete state. If the activity is in a working or
complete state, the method ignores the request. If a case worker requests to start an activity, the
PUT method ensures that the activity is in a ready state.

Because multiple case workers might decide an activity must be enabled, the
PUT method does not return an error when a request is made to enable an activity
that is already enabled. Instead, the method always returns an updated version of the activity.
