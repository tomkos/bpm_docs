# Developing a custom fault selector

## Implementing the FaultSelector interface

The
custom fault selector must implement the com.ibm.websphere.dhframework.faults.FaultSelector
interface.

```
package com.ibm.websphere.dhframework.faults; 

import commonj.connector.runtime.BindingContext; 

/** 
* A Fault Selector that determines if the input data is a business fault, 
* runtime fault or a normal response. It also determines the native fault name. 
*/ 

public interface FaultSelector 
extends BindingContext 
{ 
public static enum ResponseType { 
RESPONSE, BUSINESS\_FAULT, RUNTIME\_EXCEPTION 
}; 

/** 
* This method looks at the source object or headers from the context service to 
* determine if the response is fault or not. If the source data is read from the 
* input stream or reader, then this method should put this read data in the binding 
* context so it can be accessed by the data handler. 

* @param source 
* This can be of type InputStream, Reader or Java Object like an 
* Exception Object or the serialized object in case of JMS ObjectMessage. 
* @return Whether the response is a normal response, business fault or 
* runtime exception. 
*/ 
ResponseType getResponseType(Object source); 

/** 
* Gets the native fault name from the headers from the context service or from the 
* source object. 
* 
* @param source 
* This can be either InputStream, Reader or Java Object like an 
* Exception Object or the serialized object in case of JMS ObjectMessage. 
* @return The native fault name. 
*/ 
String getFaultName(Object source); 
}
```

The source data is shared between the fault selector
and the data handler. If the fault selector has read the data from
the input stream or reader, then the data handler will not be able
to read this data again. The fault selector has to put the read data
in the binding context so it can be used by the data handler.

## Binding context interface

The
binding context contains runtime contextual information passed from
the caller to the data handler. The BindingContext interface is used
to specify the runtime context of the data handler. The DataHandler
interface extends from BindingContext interface. Therefore, each data
handler implementation needs to implement the setBindingContext method
of the BindingContext interface.

```
public void setBindingContext( Map context)
	{
		this.context = context;
	}
```

The context is a Map. The key gives the name of the context
information and the value passed gives its value. Refer to the BindingContext
class for the information that bindings can provide in the context.
The following table contains the list of some of the relevant information
available in the context.

- Service Message Object (SMO) headers

Service Message Object headers provide protocol-specific and protocol-neutral headers to author data handlers.
