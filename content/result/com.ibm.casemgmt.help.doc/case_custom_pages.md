# Creating custom solution layouts

IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow includes
a set of layouts that you can use in your solution. You can customize the layouts to meet the
requirements of your solution. You can use the custom layouts as templates to create extra pages to
provide customized views for different roles, case types, and activities.

Solution layouts or pages provide case workers with access to cases that are in a solution. See
Solution layouts.

## Procedure

To create a solution layout:

1. Open the solution in Case Builder.
2. On the Layouts tab, create a solution layout by going to the
Solution Layouts tab. For more information, see Creating a solution layout.
3. After you create a new solution layout or a classic solution page, go back to Case Builder and assign the layout or page
to a role. For more information, see Assigning solution layouts to roles.
4. Optional: Go back to the Layouts tab and edit your
solution layouts.
