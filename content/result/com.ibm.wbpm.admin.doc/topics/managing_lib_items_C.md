## Procedure

To view, create, apply, or remove tags and tag groups for library items:

1. In Workflow Center, open a process application
or toolkit in IBM Process
Designer.
2 Choose the appropriate action in the following table: Action Instructions View tags and tag groups To sort the library items by tag: The names of the tags that have been applied to a library item are displayed in parenthesesafter the name of the library item. If there are more applied tags than can be displayed in theparentheses, you can hover over the library item to display all the applied tags in atooltip. To view the tags or tag groups that have been applied to a specific library item in acategory: Important: To view all the tags that are available, such as the Public tag, ensurethat you update the System Data Toolkit to System Data Toolkit V8.0 or later. Create tags and tag groups To create new tags and tag groups for a library item: To add new tag values to existing tag groups in a library item: Apply tags and tag groups To apply existing tags to a library item: To apply existing tag groups to a library item: Tip: You can use the Public tag for assets that can beaccessed across a toolkit and its dependencies. To add a public tag to the library item, click thearrow icon next to the library item to launch the context menu, then select Tags > Public . To view all the assets from the current library and the dependencies that are taggedas public, expand Smart Folders > Public . Remove tags and tag groups To remove a tag from a library item: To remove a tag group from a library item: Note: Although you can remove tag and tag groups from a library item, you cannot manuallyremove them from the tags list.

| View tags and tag groups   | To sort the library items by tag:  In the library, click a category. Select Tag from the drop-down list.   The names of the tags that have been applied to a library item are displayed in parentheses after the name of the library item. If there are more applied tags than can be displayed in the parentheses, you can hover over the library item to display all the applied tags in a tooltip. To view the tags or tag groups that have been applied to a specific library item in a category:  In the library, click the category that contains the library item. A list of library items is displayed. Next to the appropriate library item, click the arrow icon to launch the context menu. In the context menu, select Tags to display the tags and tag groups. The names of the tag groups are appended to the menu list. Expand one or more tag groups to display their tag values. If a check box is selected next to a tag value in a tag group, the tag group has been applied to the library item.  Important: To view all the tags that are available, such as the Public tag, ensure that you update the System Data Toolkit to System Data Toolkit V8.0 or later.                                                                                            |
| Create tags and tag groups | To create new tags and tag groups for a library item:  In the library, click the category than contains the library item. A list of library items is displayed.

In the Tag name field, specify a name for the new tag. If you want a create an associated tag group, select the Create a new tag group check box and specify a name for the new tag group in the Tag group name field. (A tag value name must be specified in the Tag name field because a tag group requires an associated tag value.) Click FINISH. The tag or tag group is applied to the library item and it is now available to apply to other library items.   To add new tag values to existing tag groups in a library item:  In the library, click the category than contains the library item. A list of library items is displayed. Next to the appropriate library item, click the arrow icon to launch the context menu. In the context menu, select Tags > tag\_group > New. The New Tag wizard opens. In the Tag name field, specify a name for the new tag value. Click FINISH. The new tag value is added to the tag group. |
