# Creating abstract business objects

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Create a business object.
2. Open the business object in the business object editor.
3. Switch to the Description tab in the Properties view.
4. Select the Abstract check box.
5. Click the link beside the check box to create an inherited
business object.

## Results

Considerations:

- You can map abstract business objects in the same way as regular
business objects.
- While you cannot have an XML instance of an abstract business
object, you can create an SDO data object of an abstract business
object by using the SDO API.
