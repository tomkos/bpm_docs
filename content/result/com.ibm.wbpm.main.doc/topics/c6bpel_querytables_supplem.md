# Supplemental query tables

Supplemental query tables in Business Process Choreographer
expose to the query table API business data that is not managed by
Business Process Choreographer. With supplemental query tables, this
external data can be used with data from the predefined query tables
when retrieving BPEL process instance information or human task information.

Supplemental query tables relate to database tables or database
views in the Business Process Choreographer database. They are query
tables that contain business data that is maintained by customer applications.
Supplemental query tables provide information in a composite query
table in addition to information that is contained in a predefined
query table.

Supplemental query tables have the following properties:

| Property        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Name            | The query table name must be unique in a Business Process Choreographer installation. When the query is run, this name is used to identify the query table that is queried.  A query table is uniquely identified using its name, which is defined as prefix.name. The maximum length of prefix.name is 28 characters. The prefix must be different to the reserved prefix 'IBM', for example, 'COMPANY.BUS\_DATA'.  Do not use a digit at the end of the table name. If a table is used multiple times within a query, the name of the table is extended with a number ranging from 0 to 9. For example, CUSTOM\_VIEW0, CUSTOM\_VIEW1 and so on. If there is already a digit at the end of your table name, Business Process Choreographer will remove this digit, which causes an QueryUnknownTableException. |
| Database name   | The name of the related table or view in the database. Only uppercase letters may be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Database schema | The schema of the related table or view in the database. Only uppercase letters can be used. The database schema must be different to the database schema of the Business Process Choreographer database. Nevertheless, the table or view must be accessible with the same JDBC data source that is used to access the Business Process Choreographer database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Attributes      | Attributes of supplemental query tables define the pieces of information that are available for queries. These attributes must match the related name of the columns in the related database table or view. The attributes are defined with a name and a type. The name is defined in uppercase. The type is one of the following types:  Boolean: A boolean value  Decimal: A floating point number  ID: An object ID of 16 bytes in length, such as TKIID of the TASK query table  Number: An integer, short, or long  String: A string  Timestamp: A timestamp                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Join            | Joins must be defined on supplemental query tables if they are attached in composite query tables. A join defines which attributes are used to correlate information in the supplemental query table with the information in the primary query table. When a join is defined, the source attribute and the target attribute must be of the same type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Authorization   | No authorization is specified for supplemental query tables, therefore, all authenticated users can see the contents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
