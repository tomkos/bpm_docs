# Managing projects

- Workflow Center

Workflow Center provides a convenient location for you to create and maintain high-level library items such as process apps, case solutions, and toolkits (collectively known as projects).
- Workflow projects

Workflow Center is the place where you create, manage, and deploy projects such as process apps, case solutions, toolkits, and templates.
- Artifact support in traditional and container runtime environments

In IBM® Business Automation Workflow, all artifacts are generally supported in the traditional WebSphere environment. However, not all artifacts are supported in the container runtime environment, such as most deprecated artifacts (like BPDs, integration services and some other services).
- Converting the target environment of projects

You can convert the target environment for a project. When you convert the target environment, there may be dependent toolkit versions or artifacts that you need to modify to enable your project to be installed and run in the corresponding runtime environment.
- Working with projects

You can import and export projects, and perform maintenance tasks such as managing versions and branches.
- Managing servers
- Managing access to the Workflow Center repository

Administrators can manage user access to the Workflow Center repository from Workflow Center.
- Installing snapshots

You install snapshots to install or update a process application or case solution on a workflow server.
- Administering the Workflow Center index

You use the Workflow Center index to conduct searches on the Workflow Center repository.
- Searching for Workflow Center assets

You can find assets, such as toolkits, process applications, case solutions, services, or business objects faster using specific syntax or tags.
- Traditional: Applying governance to a process application in the Process Center (deprecated)

 Traditional: 
In Process Center, you can apply a governance process that provides control over the installation of process applications or notifies people when a snapshot is installed or changes status. When an Installation Requested governance process is applied to a process application, requests made from Process Center to install a snapshot of that process application trigger the governance process. When a Snapshot Status Change governance process is applied, all changes to the status of a snapshot are reported.
- Setting environment variables

Set environment variables to ensure that process implementations use correct values in each deployment environment.
- System toolkits

During IBM Business Automation Workflow installation, a number of system toolkits are imported into the IBM Workflow Center repository. These system toolkits provide resources that you can use as you build your process applications.
- Managing toolkit dependencies

You can create a toolkit dependency, change the version (snapshot) of a dependency, and delete a toolkit dependency in the designer.
- Managing library items in IBM Process Designer

IBM Process Designer offers several tools to ensure that you can quickly and easily access items that you work with on a regular basis. You can move or copy items between existing or new process applications and toolkits. And you can revert to previous versions of individual library items using snapshots.
