# Building business rules: task roadmap

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Decide if a business rule is an appropriate solution for
your business process. A business rule is an ideal solution
when you want to have flexibility to change your business process
at run time.
2. Create a rule group. The rule group is the primary
element of a business rule, it provides the interface between the
business process and the rule logic. The rule group also defines date
ranges during which specific rule logic applies.
3. Decide which rule logic to use. Some business
rules are better suited to a decision table, some to a rule set.
4. Create your chosen rule logic. The rule logic
is either a rule set or a decision table.
5. Create templates for your rule logic. By creating
a template for your rule set or decision table you can build up a
library of rule logics that you can reuse in the future. The template
also allows you to stipulate which parameters of the rule logic can
be modified by the business analyst using the Business Rule Manager.
Additionally constraints can be applied to these parameters so that
the changes made with the Business Rule Manager are within acceptable
ranges.
6. Assemble your rule group into a business process, test
and deploy.
