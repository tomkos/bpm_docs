# Adapter pages

The use of adapter pages that incorporate client-side human services and display supported case
widgets results in a modern UI that is similar to that used elsewhere in IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow. The new implementation
is based on current technologies. It can be used with new or existing cases and is expected to be
the UI of the future.  See Adding widgets to an adapter page.

The following adapter pages are available in IBM Business Automation
Workflow:

- Split Case Adapter page (see Split Case pages)
- Add Case Adapter page (see Add Case pages)
- Case Details Adapter page (see Case Details pages)
- Process Task Details Adapter page (see Task Details pages)
- Process Instance Details Adapter page (see Task Details pages)
- Solution Page Adapter (see Solution layouts)

The adapter pages use the default client-side human service views that are contained in the Case
toolkit. These default client-side human service views are equivalent to the traditional case
widgets and you can see them in the Workflow Designer library by expanding
Toolkit > Case > User Interface.
