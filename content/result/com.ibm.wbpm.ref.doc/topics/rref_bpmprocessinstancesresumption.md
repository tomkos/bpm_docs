# BPMProcessInstancesResumption command

## Prerequisites

- Run the command in the connected mode; that is,
do not use the wsadmin -conntype none option.
- You can run the command from any cluster member
in a network deployment environment. However, you must first establish
the wsadmin session to the SOAP port of the cluster member from where
you are running the command.
- To access the wsadmin command, the ID being used
must have a WebSphereÂ® Application
Server role
with more privileges than the monitor role. See Administrative roles for information about
roles.
- To access the Business Automation Workflow API used
by this command, the ID being used must belong to either the bpmAdminGroup
or bpmAuthorGroup. The default name for the bpmAdminGroup is tw\_admins
and the default name for the bpmAuthorGroup is tw\_authors. See IBM Business Automation Workflow default group types for information about groups.Tip: By default, only the DeAdmin user has both the WebSphere Application
Server administrator
role and membership in the bpmAdminGroup.
