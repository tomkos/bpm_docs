## Results

## What to do next

- If databases were created in the previous installation, ensure
that the databases were dropped. See Reinstallation cannot create new profile.
- If you uninstalled Db2, ensure
that the BPMINST directory was deleted.
- If you uninstalled Db2 , deletethe remaining Db2 entries in the/etc/service file. This is necessary because the new installation requires thatport 50000 be available. Update the following file to remove any referencesto Db2 and port50000 . For example, remove the following line:db2c\_bpminst 50000/tcp ordb2c\_db2inst1 50000/tcp
    - /etc/services
    - C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\services

```
db2c\_bpminst 50000/tcp
```

```
db2c\_db2inst1 50000/tcp
```
