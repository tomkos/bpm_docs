| TASK\_ID                   | The primary key of this task in the Business Performance Data Warehouse.                                                                                                                                         |
| FUNCTIONAL\_TASK\_ID        | The primary key in the Business Performance Data Warehouse of the process to which this entry corresponds. In the case where this row corresponds to the beginning of a process instance, it will equal TASK\_ID. |
| CREATION\_TIME             | The date and time that the task was created.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| START\_TIME                | The date and time that the task was started. If CREATION\_TIME and START\_TIME are not equal, the lag indicates that the task was not immediately started by the user.                                             |
