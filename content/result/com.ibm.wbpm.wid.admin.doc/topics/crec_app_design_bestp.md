# Error prevention as part of application design

A strong system of governance, complete with architectural and
design guidelines and appropriate standards combined with reviews
and checkpoints are essential to building the right kind of application.

- Implementing design considerations for exceptions and faults
- Implementing an error handling strategy that uses existing IBMÂ® Integration
Designer error
handling capabilities and tools
- Creating connectivity groups and using module application design
techniques

- Connectivity groups

A connectivity group represents a specific pattern of behavior found in an SCA module.
- Application design considerations for exceptions and faults

You need to consider your application design so that it can take advantage of the error handling and fault processing capabilities in IBM Integration Designer.
