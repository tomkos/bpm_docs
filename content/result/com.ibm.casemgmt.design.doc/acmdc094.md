# Importing workflow assets

To import a solution that was defined in Case Builder, you can use the Workflow Center or Case administration client.

For solutions that have been promoted to Workflow Center,
click Import and follow the prompts. For more information, see Importing and exporting projects.

If you are using a version control system (VCS), you can extract the solution files and solution
manifest from the VCS to a directory that is accessible to the administration client.

- Importing case assets by using a solution package

For case solutions that haven't been promoted, use the Case administration client to import a solution package from one environment to another. The solution package that you import includes all assets that were created for the solution in Case Builder. For promoted solutions, you import the snapshot or install the solution project .zip file.
- Importing workflow assets by using a solution manifest

If an integrated version control system (VCS) is used, you can import solution assets that were exported from the VCS.
