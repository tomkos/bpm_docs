# Planning to install

- Test environment

You have the option to use either a local test environment or a remote one. Developers using systems that are constrained on resources (CPU, memory, disk space) should consider configuring a remote test environment and pointing their IBM Integration Designer at that remote environment for testing their processes and monitor models.
- Security considerations

In IBM Integration Designer 24.0.0.0, both administrative security and application security are enabled by default.
- Coexistence considerations

If you plan to install multiple IBM Eclipse-based products on the same workstation, review the information in this section.
