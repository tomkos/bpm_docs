- Business rules

A business rule is a condition that must be satisfied when a business activity is being performed. A rule can enforce a business policy, make a decision, or infer new data from existing data.
- When to use business rules

A business rule is anything that captures and implements business policies and practices. A rule can enforce business policy, make a decision, or infer new data from existing data.
- Building business rules: task roadmap

A high-level view of the development of a business rule is presented.
- Rule group editor

A rule group controls the timing and implementation of business rules.
- Rule set editor

A rule set captures decision-making business logic in the form of a series of if-then statements.
- Decision table editor

A decision table captures multi-conditional decision-making business logic in tabular format.
- Choosing between a rule set and a decision table

You can capture business rule logic using either a rule set or a decision table. Here are some suggestions for how to decide which format to use.
- Creating a rule group

Create a rule group as a container for your business rules.
- Creating a rule set

This topic provides instructions on how to create a new rule set.
- Creating a decision table

This topic provides instructions on how to create a new decision table.
- Weak type support with business rules

Business object definitions can have XSD wildcards that can be used in business rules logic.
- Choosing the correct template parameter values

To make sure that you don't have any syntax inconsistencies with template parameters in the runtime environment, understand the following.
- Creating decision table templates

Use a template to define the implementation and parameters for either a condition or an action value in a decision table. This template can then be used to create new cells with the same format, but with different parameter values.
- Using templates in your decision table

The individual cells of your decision table can be populated with an existing template for the value. In this way, you can create a similar expression without having to redefine the implementation, and by making changes to the parameters within the constraints specified.
- Creating rule set templates

Use a rule set template to define the implementation and parameters for an if-then or action rule. This template can then be used to create new instances of the same rule using different parameters.
- Creating a new rule from a template in the rule set editor

Rules can be created from existing templates. In this way, you can create a similar rule without having to redefine the implementation, and by making changes to the parameters within the constraints specified.
- Refactoring business rules

When you refactor parts of your business rules, dependencies on those parts are automatically and universally updated throughout the product as a whole.
- Launching the Business Process Rules Manager

The Business Process Rules Manager is a web client that allows dynamic control of parameter values in template based rules that are deployed to the Websphere Business Automation Workflow.
