# Select (deprecated)

The Select control gets its list of items from a business object that it is bound to or from a
selection service. If the Select control is bound to a business object, that object must be a list.
The business object also identifies whether items in that list are selected. If the Select control
gets its list from a selection service, configuration options specify the Ajax service, the list
that the service provides, and which item or items are selected.

| Contains the list of selection options, if specified.  The data binding overrides the list that the Selection service configuration option provides. If a data binding is not specified, you must identity a Selection service to provide the list. The list can consist of Strings, NameValuePairs, or user-defined data objects. When specifying a list of user-defined data objects, the Display name property and Value property configuration options are required. | ANY (List)  |

| Selected Items               | One or more currently selected items if you are using a selection service and the list type is multiple selection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ANY(List)                                              |
| Selection Service            | An Ajax service that provides the selection list based on input text. Use this option as an alternative to binding the Selection list option to a list object.   The resulting selection list generated by the service is made up of Strings, NameValuePairs, or user-defined objects. Note that the use of user-defined objects requires display name and value properties. You can specify values for these properties with the Display name property and Value property options. The default is the Default Selection Service. Using the default service as a guide, provide an appropriate service implementation for the selection service. | Service Input: text(String) Output: results(ANY)(List) |
| Selection Service Input Text | Text that the selection service uses to determine which selection list to provide.   The text specified here is passed as the text input argument of the selection service and the selection service subsequently uses this information to determine the output values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | String                                                 |
| Display Name Property        | The property used as the display name for data objects in the selection list that are not Strings or NameValuePairs. The name of the property specified here is used when the selection list is being populated.  For example, say that the selection list is an array of data objects with properties title (String) and author (String).   If title is specified as the display name property, the selection list would be populated with the value of title property for each array member.                                                                                                                                                   | String                                                 |
| Value Property               | The property used as the value for user-defined objects in the selection list that are not Strings or NameValuePairs.This option is ignored when the selection list is made up of Strings or NameValuePairs. When the selection list consists of Strings, the string itself is used as the value. When the selection list consists of NameValuePairs, "value" property of each NameValuePair is used as the value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | String                                                 |
| Disable Sorting              | Disable sorting to use the list order instead of alphabetical order. Items on the list are sorted in alphabetical order by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Boolean                                                |
