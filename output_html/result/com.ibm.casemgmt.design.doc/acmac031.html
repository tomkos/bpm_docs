<h1>Adding solutions to a project area by using the command line</h1>

<h2>Before you begin</h2>

<p>Be sure to have your completed configuration checklist available.</p>

<h2>About this task</h2>

<p>When a business analyst creates a solution in Case Builder, the solution is added
to the project area that the user belongs to. However, you can assign
the solution to a different project area. When you assign a solution
to a project area, the solution is removed from the project area to
which it was previously assigned.</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To add solutions to a project area:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the current directory to the
install_root/CaseManagement/configure directory, where
install_root is the location where Business Automation Workflow is
installed.
2 Add one or more solutions by runningthe following command. Do not enter any line breaks when you enterthe command. configmgr_cl addSolutions -projectAreaName project_area_name -profile myprofile -solutions solution_name [-solutions solution_name_n ] [-help] -projectAreaName project_area_name Specifies the name of the project area to add solutions to. Thedefault project area is named dev_env_connection_definition. -profile myprofile Specifies the profile to use. The myprofile value can be one of the following items: -solutions solution_name Specifies the solution name to add to the project area. You canenter multiple -solutions solution_name optionson the same command line. -help Optional: Shows a brief message on the command syntax insteadof running the command.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>
configmgr\_cl addSolutions -projectAreaName project\_area\_name
 -profile myprofile
 -solutions solution\_name [-solutions solution\_name\_n]
 [-help]
</code></p>

<pre><code>- The name of the profile, such as develop1. The profile is located in the
</code></pre>

<p>install_root/CaseManagement/configure/profiles directory.
install_root is the location where IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow is installed.
    - The full path to the profile directory, such as
"install_root\CaseManagement\configure\profiles\develop1" or
/install_root/CaseManagement/configure/profiles/develop1.
    - The full path to the profile input file, such as
"install_root\CaseManagement\configure\profiles\develop1\develop1.cfgp"
or
/install_root/CaseManagement/configure/profiles/develop1/develop1.cfgp.
3. Repeat the previous step to add more solutions to the project
area.</p>
