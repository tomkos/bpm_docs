# How to use views to store or view documents

- BPM Documents: BPM Document List view (as described in the topics Working with BPM documents in the Document List view).
- External ECM documents: Document Explorer view or ECM Document List view (as described in the
topics Document Explorer and ECM Document List.)

- Configure the document view that you are using with the File Viewer view. (You must also
configure the File Viewer view.)
- Set a configuration option for the document view to display the document in a new window.

- Configuring coach views for storing and viewing Enterprise Content Management (ECM) documents

You can store and view documents on an ECM server from a client application, such as Workplace or Process Portal, by configuring one of the document coach views (Document Explorer or ECM Document List view) and, optionally, a File Viewer view.
