# Generating names for process instances

## About this task

## Procedure

To modify the way that the process instance names for a given process are
generated:

1. Open the process and go to the Overview tab.
2. In the Advanced section, change the text in the
Instance name field if you want the name of each instance to be something
other than the process name. Be sure to retain the quotation marks around the text. By
default, the instance ID is appended to the instance name that you specify, using the
tw.system.process.instanceId variable. You can remove this variable or use the
variable picker to choose additional variables.
3. Click Save or Finish Editing.
