# Choosing between XPath and Java in your BPEL process

- When you are designing the process to be used or edited in another
set of tools.
- When you are planning on executing the process in a runtime environment
other than IBMÂ® Workflow
Server.

If you can use either one, and are unsure of which one is best,
then consider the following. Typically, a decision like this can be
based on two things: the nature of the needed code, and your familiarity
with the programming languages in question. Where XPath is well-suited
for simple data-driven expressions, Java is better for modelling more complicated code. However,
if you are not very familiar with Java and want to extend the limits of the XPath language, you
can use the visual snippet editor to graphically create and manipulate
snippets of Java code.
