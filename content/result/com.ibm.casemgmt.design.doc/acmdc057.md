## Procedure

To verify the solution:

1. Log in to Case Client.
2. From the list of available solutions, expand your solution,
and click Manage Roles.
3. Click Add Case to add a case to
the solution.
Verify that the preconditions for the case
are met.
4. Open and complete a work item from the in-basket to verify
that the page works correctly.
5. Verify that case types, tasks, and roles are created and
working. 
To verify that the other components in the solution
work correctly, open and test other pages and cases. You can search
for cases by going to the case pages and searching for a case by date.
