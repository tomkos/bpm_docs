# Invocation of Services

- Service Invoke and Callout nodes

You can call a service using either a Service Invoke mediation primitive or a Callout node.
- Service invocation styles

Using IBM Workflow Server, you can make service invocations using a Service Invoke mediation primitive, or a Callout node. The service invocation interacts with the invoked service in different ways. The invocation can be synchronous or asynchronous. There are further variations for an asynchronous invocation. The choice of synchronous, or the specific type of asynchronous interaction is termed the Service invocation style. Service invocations can be made by both request and response flows.
- Dynamic invocation

When a mediation module is developed and deployed, the flow of messages through the module is determined by the wiring of components. The configuration of the components is used to determine which external services are to be called.
