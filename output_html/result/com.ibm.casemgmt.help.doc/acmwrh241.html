<h1>Task Toolbar widget</h1>

<p>The Task Toolbar widget is included in the Process Task Details Adapter page by default. However,
you can add the Task Toolbar widget to any page.</p>

<p>You can edit the settings of the Task Toolbar widget to control whether the following information
is  displayed in the header information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Task name</li>
<li>Process instance name</li>
<li>Parent case title (ID)</li>
<li>Task due date</li>
</ul>

<p>When the process instance name is displayed, it includes a link that opens the Process Instances
view and displays it in its own Case tab. The associated process diagram is also displayed in its
own Case tab.</p>

<p>When the parent case title (ID) is displayed, it includes a link that opens the parent case in
the Case Details page.</p>

<ol>
<li>On the Pages tab of Case Builder, expand Task Details pages and click the Process Task Details
Adapter link to open the page in Page Designer.</li>
<li>In Page Designer, click the Edit Settings icon of the Task Toolbar
widget.</li>
<li>In the Task Toolbar dialog box, ensure that the check boxes are selected for the header
information that you want to display, and then click OK.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Task Toolbar widget events</li>
</ul>

<p>The Task Toolbar widget handles an incoming event to open a process task.</p>
