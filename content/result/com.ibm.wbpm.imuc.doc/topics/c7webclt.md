# Business Process Choreographer Explorer overview

When you start Business Process Choreographer Explorer, the objects
that you see in the user interface and the actions that you can take
depend on the user group that you belong to and the authorization
granted to that group. For example, if you are a business process
administrator, you are responsible for the smooth operation of deployed
BPEL processes. You can view information about process and task templates,
process instances, task instances, and their associated objects. You
can also act on these objects; for example, you can start new process
instances, create and start tasks, repair and restart failed activities,
manage work items, and delete completed process instances and task
instances. However, if you are a user, you can view and act on only
those tasks that have been assigned to you.
