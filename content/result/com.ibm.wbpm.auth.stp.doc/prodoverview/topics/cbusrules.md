# Business rules

If there is condition with a variable, for example, a business
rule can change the value in that variable at run time. Created
by a visual programming language, a business rule makes a decision
based on context. The decision can be simple or complex. Business
rules are nonprocedural and the rules can be changed independently
of an application.Business rules determine the outcome of a process
based on a context.

Business rules are used in everyday business situations to make
a decision given a specific set of circumstances. This decision may
require many rules to cover all the circumstances. Business rules
within a business process allow applications to respond quickly to
changing business conditions. In an insurance corporation, for example,
a business rule for approving car insurance to an applicant could
be: If the applicant is male and over 25 years old, and the car
category is sports, and he has been insured with us for the past 5
years, then approve the application for insurance at a fee of $100
per month.

You can use several different approaches when you create business
rules. You can create if-then rules or decision tables, all of which
will shape the outcome of your process. Note that these rules are
independent of the process itself, meaning that you can change the
rules at any time without having to redo your process. For example,
based on where your business is located, you might have a rule that
says: If the date is between December 26th and January 1st, then
offer a post-holiday sale discount of 20%. However, if sales continue
to be too slow, you could at any time modify the discount to 40%.
