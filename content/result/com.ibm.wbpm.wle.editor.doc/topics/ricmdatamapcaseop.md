# Data mapping in case operations (deprecated)

This section shows you the mapping between
the input and output fields.

- Input and output map for a create case operation
- Input and output map for a search case operation
- Input and output map for a retrieve case operation
- Input and output map for an update case operation

## Input and output map for a create
case operation

Input map:

- Case properties: An array of key-value
pairs to initialize the properties of the case. The types are generated
by the Generate Types button when you build
your service. The properties have an integer, float, boolean, string
or datetime type. The cardinality (number of elements) of the properties
is either a single element or multiple elements.

Output map:

- Case reference: A reference to the IBMÂ® Business Automation
Workflow case.
It maps to the CaseReference business object found in the System Data
toolkit.
- Return code: A return code indicating if
the operation was successful.
- Response message: A response message from
the server.

## Input and output map for a search
case operation

Input map:

- CMIS query: A string of text containing
the Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) query.

Output map:

- Case references: An array of IBM Business Automation
Workflow CaseReference
objects that match the query. They map to the CaseReference business
object found in the System Data toolkit.
- Return code: A return code indicating if
the operation was successful.
- Response message: A response message from
the server.

## Input and output map for a
retrieve case operation

Input map:

Case
reference: A reference to an IBM Business Automation
Workflow case.
It maps to the CaseReference business object found in the System Data
toolkit.

Output map:

- Case instance: An instance of the case
type. The types are generated by the Generate Types button when you build your service.
- Return code: A return code indicating if
the operation was successful.
- Response message: A response message from
the server.

## Input and output map for an
update case operation

Input map:

- Case reference: A reference to an IBM Business Automation
Workflow case.
It maps to the CaseReference business object found in the System Data
toolkit.
- Case properties: An array of key-value
pairs to initialize the properties of the case. The types are generated
by the Generate Types button when you build
your service. The properties have an integer, float, boolean, string
or datetime type. The cardinality (number of elements) of the properties
is either a single element or multiple elements.

Output map:

- Return code: A return code indicating if
the operation was successful.
- Response message: A response message from
the server.
