# Getting fixes

## About this task

## Procedure

1. Determine which fix you need.  Check the list
of IBM® Business Automation Workflow recommended
fixes to confirm that your software is at the latest maintenance level.
Check the list of problems fixed in the IBM IBM Business Automation Workflow fix
readme documentation that is available for each listed fix pack and
refresh pack to see if IBM has already published an individual
fix to resolve your problem. To determine what fixes are available
using IBM Support Assistant, run a query on fix from
the search page.Individual fixes are published as often as necessary
to resolve defects in IBM Business Automation Workflow. In
addition, two kinds of cumulative collections of fixes, called fix
packs and refresh packs, are published periodically for IBM Business Automation Workflow, in
order to bring users up to the latest maintenance level. You should
install these update packages as early as possible in order to prevent
problems.
Note: Fixes specific to the underlying WebSphere® Application
Server product may also be obtained from the WebSphere Application
Server Support Site or from the WebSphere Application
Server Support team. Fixes for individual APARs for WebSphere Application
Server generally can be applied without affecting IBM Business Automation Workflow. However,
consult with the software requirements page before updating WebSphere Application Server with cumulative
collections of fixes (fix packs). First check to see that the cumulative
fix has passed certification, or contact the Support team for verification.
2. Download the fix. Open the download document and follow
the link in the Download package section.
When downloading the file, ensure the name of the maintenance
file is not changed.  This includes both intentional changes and inadvertent
changes caused by certain web browsers or download utilities.
3. Apply the fix. Follow the instructions in the Installation
Instructions section of the download document. For more
information, see the Updating IBM Business Automation Workflowtopic
in the Installing and configuring documentation.
4. Optional: To receive weekly notification of
fixes and updates, subscribe to My Support email updates.
