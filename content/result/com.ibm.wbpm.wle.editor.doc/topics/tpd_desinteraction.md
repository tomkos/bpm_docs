# Designing process interactions for business users

- Configuring a role-based business user interface

 Before you deploy your process application, you need to configure different elements in the process to control the types of actions that different business users can perform in Workplace or Process Portal Workplace, the types of data they can search for and view, and the dashboards that they can access.
- Developing flexible and efficient process applications

After you have mapped out your process to include all of the normal task flows for normal process execution, you can optimize your process to make it more flexible and efficient for the business users who will be working with the application in Process Portal.
- Setting up collaboration features for business users

IBM Business Automation Workflow provides several features that allow business users to collaborate with other users while working with processes.
- Enabling process instance management

In Process Portal, process owners can use the Process Performance dashboard to review the progress of processes and their instances. If the business process is enabled and process owners are authorized, they can also act on individual process instances in the Gantt chart to resolve issues, such as bottlenecks.
- Generating names for process instances

When you run a process, a default name is created for the process instance. This name is visible to business users in Process Portal, allowing them to distinguish between different instances of a process as they complete their work. In designer, you can change the way these process instance names are generated.
