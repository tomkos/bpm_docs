# Some search documents do not behave as expected when added to specific widgets

Issues occur with a saved search in IBM Content
Navigator that prevent
you from adding these search documents to the Case Document widget.

You can add these search documents to the Work Item Attachment widget, and the documents can be
opened. However, the documents do not perform a search or display search results.
