# JMS integration and resource adapters

Use a JMS provider for JCA 1.5 resource adapter when you want to
integrate with an external JCA 1.5-compliant JMS system. External
services compliant with JCA 1.5 can receive messages and send messages
to integrate with your service component architecture (SCA) components
using the SIB JMS resource adapter.

The use of other provider-specific JCA 1.5 resource adapters is
not supported.
