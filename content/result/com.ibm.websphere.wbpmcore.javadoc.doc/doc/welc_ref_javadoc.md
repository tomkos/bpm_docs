# Reference: Java APIs and SPIs

This documentation provides the details of the application
programming interfaces (APIs) and system programming interfaces (SPIs)
that are supported by 
IBMÂ® Business Process Automation Workflow.

The table of contents for the API and SPI documentation presents
a package list  that is organized by package name, such as com.ibm.websphere.sca.

Alternatively, you can use the search to find a package or class
by its name, such as com.ibm.websphere.sca or ServiceManager.

If you want to use the WebSphere MQ
classes to create custom MQ data bindings, see the IBM Integration Designer topic  Example of custom MQ data bindings.
JMS and MQ data bindings details are described in the IBM Integration Designer topic  JMS, MQ JMS and generic JMS data bindings.

If you want to create a user-defined JMS data binding, see   JMS data bindings.

For information about programming with the business object programming
model, see Business objects. Business object
instances are represented by the commonj.sdo.DataObject interface.
The business object programming model behavior is based on the Service
Data Object 2.1 specification. For additional information, see the
SDO 2.1 for Java specification, tutorials and javadocs on the Web: OASIS Open CSA Specifications.

For reference information about the supported APIs and SPIs for IBM WebSphere Application Server,
see API Specification for WebSphere Application Server
and SPI Specification for WebSphere Application Server.
