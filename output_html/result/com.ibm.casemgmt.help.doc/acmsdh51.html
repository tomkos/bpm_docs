<h1>Activity states</h1>

<p>In addition to activity state, there is a case state. When all required activities are completed
and there are no more running activities, the case is marked complete. For example, after an
activity is started, it is in Working state and the activity must be
completed for the case to complete, even if the activity was initially set as optional.</p>
