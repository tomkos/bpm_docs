Designer

- The explicit save mode: In this mode, your changes are not saved until you click
Save (similar to the desktop Process Designer). After you save your changes, the artifacts
become available to other users for editing.

make it. As a result, when you close an editor or the browser crashes, your changes are still
preserved. The  indicates the artifacts that you change. At this point, other users who have the same

others for editing, you must click Finish Editing
 after you complete your changes.
