# Using business calendars within human tasks

## About this task

To use a business calendar in a human task, proceed as follows:

## Procedure

1. If you have not already done so, create a business calendar
or import one from WebSphereÂ® Modeler. For detailed instructions on how to do this,
refer to Business calendars.
2. In the Properties view of the task settings, click the Duration tab.
3. From the Calendar Type list, select
the business calendar that you created or imported in Step 1.
4. Using the remaining fields, configure the amount of time
that this human task should wait for an action, knowing that the business
calendar will compensate for all non-contiguous aspects of the interval
of time. Information on how to configure these fields can
be found in the topic Setting duration values for your human task
