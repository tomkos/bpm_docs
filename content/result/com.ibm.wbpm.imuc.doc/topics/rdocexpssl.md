# Document Explorer usage with the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)

When you create user interfaces such as a client-side human service, the Document Explorer is
used as a means for the user to download documents from Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems.
See Responsive Document Explorer. The Document Explorer is added to coaches and
coach views, which to a user is an element in a user interface. With Document Explorer, a document
is downloaded through Process Portal to a mobile
device like a cell phone. However, that download fails if SSL is not configured correctly.

Therefore, if you are using SSL security, you must be aware of components like the Document
Explorer that have a dependency on the SSL configuration. To verify that your SSL security is
correctly configured, test your SSL configuration by downloading documents with mobile devices like
cell phones and tablets. Mobile devices are frequently the means of downloading documents by your
users.
