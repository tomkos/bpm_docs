# How This SPI Document Is Organized

- Overview
The Overview page is the front page of this SPI document and provides a list of all packages with a summary for each.  This page can also contain an overall description of the set of packages.
- Package Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and interfaces, with a summary for each. This page can contain six categories:

## Package

Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and interfaces, with a summary for each. This page can contain six categories:

- Interfaces (italic)
- Classes
- Enums
- Exceptions
- Errors
- Annotation Types
- Class/Interface Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a class/interface description, summary tables, and detailed member descriptions: Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.

## Class/Interface

Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a class/interface description, summary tables, and detailed member descriptions:

- Class inheritance diagram
- Direct Subclasses
- All Known Subinterfaces
- All Known Implementing Classes
- Class/interface declaration
- Class/interface description

- Nested Class Summary
- Field Summary
- Constructor Summary
- Method Summary

- Field Detail
- Constructor Detail
- Method Detail

Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.

- Annotation Type Each annotation type has its own separate page with the following sections:

## Annotation Type

Each annotation type has its own separate page with the following sections:

- Annotation Type declaration
- Annotation Type description
- Required Element Summary
- Optional Element Summary
- Element Detail
- Enum Each enum has its own separate page with the following sections:

## Enum

Each enum has its own separate page with the following sections:

- Enum declaration
- Enum description
- Enum Constant Summary
- Enum Constant Detail
- Tree (Class Hierarchy) There is a Class Hierarchy page for all packages, plus a hierarchy for each package. Each hierarchy page contains a list of classes and a list of interfaces. The classes are organized by inheritance structure starting with java.lang.Object . The interfaces do not inherit from java.lang.Object .

## Tree (Class Hierarchy)

There is a Class Hierarchy page for all packages, plus a hierarchy for each package. Each hierarchy page contains a list of classes and a list of interfaces. The classes are organized by inheritance structure starting with java.lang.Object. The interfaces do not inherit from java.lang.Object.

- When viewing the Overview page, clicking on "Tree" displays the hierarchy for all packages.
- When viewing a particular package, class or interface page, clicking "Tree" displays the hierarchy for only that package.
- Deprecated SPI
The Deprecated SPI page lists all of the SPI that have been deprecated. A deprecated SPI is not recommended for use, generally due to improvements, and a replacement SPI is usually given. Deprecated SPIs may be removed in future implementations.
- Index
The Index contains an alphabetic list of all classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.
- Prev/Next
These links take you to the next or previous class, interface, package, or related page.
- Frames/No Frames
These links show and hide the HTML frames.  All pages are available with or without frames.
- All Classes
The All Classes link shows all classes and interfaces except non-static nested types.
- Serialized Form
Each serializable or externalizable class has a description of its serialization fields and methods. This information is of interest to re-implementors, not to developers using the SPI. While there is no link in the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going to any serialized class and clicking "Serialized Form" in the "See also" section of the class description.
- Constant Field Values
The Constant Field Values page lists the static final fields and their values.
