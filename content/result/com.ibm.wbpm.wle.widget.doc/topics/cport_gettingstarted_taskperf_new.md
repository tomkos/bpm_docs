## Prerequisites

- To see the Team Performance dashboard,
you must be a member of the Managers team.
- To see tasks in the dashboard, the corresponding activities in the business process definition
must be assigned to a lane or a team. Activities that have deprecated assignment options are not
displayed in the dashboard.
- To manage a team's tasks, you must be a member
of a team of managers. All snapshots of a process
are considered when determining the authorisation for team management. If you are a member of a team
of managers for any snapshot, you can manage the team's tasks.

## Overview page

This page gives you a broad view of where your team is with its current workload. All days and times are based on your time zone.

- Change the time interval that is used on the x-axis. For example, to investigate the task
completion or arrival rate during a day, change the time interval to
Hours.
- See the net change for a bar in the chart by hovering
over the bar.

- See the dashboard for an individual team member by selecting
the person's name in the roster.

## Team Tasks page

This page gives you a breakdown of the work in progress for the team. The information can help
you to understand the status of your team's work and whether reallocating tasks to balance workloads
is necessary. Use the search filter to display tasks in the list that meet certain filter criteria.
All days and times are based on your time zone.

- See the tasks for a specific due date and who they are assigned to by clicking a bar in the
histogram. The tasks list shows the associated tasks. The people at the top of the roster own the
tasks in the filtered list.
- Filter the tasks in the list by entering a search filter. The people at the top of the roster
own the tasks in the filtered list. The histogram is also filtered to show only the tasks that apply
to the search filter. Clear the filter by clicking the X icon at the end of
the search filter field.
- Assign or reassign tasks in the list by hovering over an assigned name.
- See the dashboard for an individual team member by selecting
the person's name in the roster.

the list.

## Team member's page

members from this page.

X icon at the end of the search filter field.
- Reassign tasks in the list by hovering over the assigned name.
- See the business data for the task by clicking on the shaded area of the task.

the list.
