<h1>Roles in solutions</h1>

<p>Because you define roles at the solution level, you can reuse those
roles across all case types when you design the solution. You can
also choose to create a role that is applied only to a specific case
type. When you create tasks or steps, you can assign roles to the
task or step from roles that are already defined for the solution,
or you can create a new role for the solution.</p>

<p>After you create the solution, you assign users and groups that are defined in your LDAP server
to roles in the Case Client. For
example, some roles that might create for an automobile claims solution are field agent, insurance
agent, claims adjuster, supervisor, or fraud investigator. The roles define which in-baskets and
Case Details pages a case worker sees when using Case Client.</p>

<h2>Manager team</h2>

<p>You can assign a manager team to a case role that you create. By assigning a manager team to a
case role, you enable the members of the manager team to oversee and manage the worker's work in the
case role that they manage. Assigning a manager team to a role is optional, and does not require
that the members of the manager team be administrative users. Case Client does not expose any additional
functionality when a manager team is added to a role.</p>
