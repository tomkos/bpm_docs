# Building services in the desktop Process Designer
(deprecated)

The type of service that you choose to create depends upon the
requirements of the activity. For example, if an activity requires
integration with an external system, such as a database, you can create
an integration service. If an activity requires that call center personnel
enter data about customer requests, you can create a human service
with a coach.
